comment,nhpomxo,t1_nhp3d9c,Analysis: Growth in British renewables cutting electricity prices by…,"I'm in UK - there is a big difference between the wholesale power price of electricity, which can even go negative, and what consumers pay. Bills include wholesale plus policy costs (CfDs/RO), balancing/constraints, capacity market, networks, VAT, etc.

The current installed base of renewables in UK is pretty expensive, around £120 per MHW, and it will take many, many years for those legacy contracts to expire. However new renewables are cheaper, so adding in new renewables will reduce the average cost base of renewables, ultimately reducing the prices the consumers pay, but that will take a while.

My solution was to install solar + battery. Immediate 70% savings, but of course, that is only if you ignore the £14500 I have to pay back lol, which in some ways mirror the macro situation in the grid in the UK.

What UK should have done is seperate the capital cost of renewables from the price of electricity and paid for it via general taxation, which would have made the costs and benefits much clearer, and lowered the price of electricity, which would have promoted electrification of heating via heatpumps.",Economy-Fee5830,1,1759583628,04-10-2025 13:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nxqd7u/analysis_growth_in_british_renewables_cutting/nhpomxo/

post,1nxfnid,,Trump administration cancels nearly $8 billion in climate funding to blue states: Vought,"Key Points:
The Trump administration has canceled nearly $8 billion in funding for projects in primarily Democratic-controlled states, a top administration official said on Wednesday.

The move came hours after the same official, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, revealed that the Trump administration had frozen about $18 billion in federal funding to two major infrastructure projects in New York City.

“Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled,” Vought wrote in a post on the social media site X.",Lifegoesonforever,418,1759537119,04-10-2025 00:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nxfnid/trump_administration_cancels_nearly_8_billion_in/

comment,nhoeez5,t3_1nxfnid,Trump administration cancels nearly $8 billion in climate funding to blue states: Vought,"Setting aside how immoral this is Trump should understand that taking money away from blue states ultimately means less support for red states. Blue states finance a lot of the social programs for red states and provide services to people in red states. Treating them like different countries is essentially going to destroy the whole country. Of course, people like Trump are not interested in anything that works. They just like to see people they hate getting hurt even if it hurts them too.

One last thing. I’m from Texas which is a 55/45 state in favor of republicans. This means that 45% of the state is getting benefits even though Trump hates them. California is about a mirror opposite the other way 55/45 in favor of democrats. This means that 45% of the state that is republican is being punished for no logical reason. The whole thing is probably close to a wash practically but it makes a lot of people on both sides really pissed.

comment,nhnupld,t1_nhnu419,Trump administration cancels nearly $8 billion in climate funding to blue states: Vought,"Here are the basics of the science:



* CO2 in the atmosphere absorbs IR

* The earth's surface emits IR

* We are currently increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by 6% per decade

* We know the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere is from ancient carbon that we burn by looking at the isotopes of carbon

* We have increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by 50% in the last 150 years

* Current rate of temperature increase over the last 30 years is 2.4 C per century, far faster than natural increase

* Global mean surface temperature is 1.5C warmer than it was 150 years ago

* Over the last 2.5 million years temperatures have not been higher than today

* Atmospheric CO2 is now higher than the last 15 million years.

While I understand the focus on disaster/lethal fires, i think it's worth pointing out that this is the context of wildfires trends that are complicated: there's different metrics (fire weather, burnt area, intense fires only, large fires only, fires in certain ecosystems (e.g., forests) only, etc), different time scales, measurement methods, etc... Global burnt area, for instance, shows no global trend:

comment,nhgnt14,t3_1nwhsxm,This is not fair,"I read an article the other day that pointed out that part of the reason that solar is being installed at such a high rate is that people can do small installations (eg on their house).

Solar can avoid big government issues like long lead time, change of mind, corruption etc.

Everywhere in the world is going to be affected by climate change, it's just that a lot of people haven't realised it yet.  Even here in Australia, in the past if we had a bushfire we only had one big one at a time, but now we're finding out that we'll have two or more huge bushfires all at the same time - which makes it very hard to share fire fighting resources around.

Please, look to the future.  Actively promote solar in your area, it might be for houses or it might be for some sort of communal system.  Especially when you add battery storage, it's the future.

If your area can build up energy reserves through solar & battery then commercial activity & the economy will improve & life will become more sustainable & enjoyable.

It's ironic that part of the cause of the problem (manufacturing & technology) will also be a big part of the solution.",fitblubber,6,1759451601,03-10-2025 00:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nwhsxm/this_is_not_fair/nhgnt14/

comment,nhgw4um,t3_1nwhsxm,This is not fair,"At the risk of sounding like a climate denier, I would point out that climate change may be causing Africa, and particularly parts of the Sahara region to become more humid.

This is consistent with the [African humid period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period), during which time the Sahara was green and covered with enormous lakes and rivers.  This was fairly recent, lasting from 14,500 years ago to 5,000 years ago.  This is why the Sahara still has substantial groundwater reserves today.  During this time, the earth's temperature was believed to be 4-7 degrees hotter than pre-industrial averages.  Granted, the reasons for the higher temperatures during this time are different that what carbon pollution is causing.  There is some evidence to suggest there may be some similar effects though.",Ajax465,1,1759454525,03-10-2025 01:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nwhsxm/this_is_not_fair/nhgw4um/

comment,nhqfi6b,t3_1nwhsxm,This is not fair,"Yes it is unfair. 

The biggest cumulative contributors to global warming from co2 emissions are:

1. U.S. (Almost 450 billion tonnes)
2. EU 27 (300 billion tonnes, if you include the U.K. it’s almost 400 billion tonnes).
3. China (almost 300 billion tonnes)

The U.S. and the EU place heavy tariffs on imported EVs preventing the transition to cleaner energy vehicles. The U.S. currently slaps huge tariffs on imported solar panels, the EU also had massive tariffs on solar but eventually removed them. 

On an annual basis China is currently the largest emitter of co2, but they are also the largest producer of solar, wind and hydro power. Without the Chinese entering these renewable sectors these renewable products would be substantially more expensive.",ThroatEducational271,1,1759592411,04-10-2025 15:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nwhsxm/this_is_not_fair/nhqfi6b/

comment,nhqgou8,t1_nhjna43,This is not fair,"Yes the Chinese continue to build new coal plants, but they’re decommissioning old ones at the same time.

Moreover the Chinese coal plants are actually ideal for 50% of the time because they exhaust renewables first, coal acts as a backup. 

Regardless, the U.S. is the largest cumulative emitter, followed by the EU and then China. And China’s per capita emissions (despite all the coal) has always been lower than the U.S. even today. 

Moreover at least China is massively investing in renewables and is the largest producer of solar, wind and hydro power by a HUGE margin. 

So maybe don’t point your finger at China, turn it 180 degrees to the west.

post,1nwgl5w,,"Need Advice- Career path in agriculture, sustainability and climate change adaptation","I, M27, from India, am planning to apply for an Masters in Management (focusing on Sustainability) in Europe, especially at INSEAD, HEC and University of Mannheim.

I did my bachelor's in Agriculture (4 years) and master's in Environment Management (2 years) at a top government institute. In my master's thesis, I worked closely with 500 farmers and collected data on why they are using synthetic inputs (fertilizer and pesticide), what is the reason behind their overuse, and who is their source of information. This also led to 3 publications.

Between 2022 and 2024, I worked as a freelance researcher in the projects focusing on biodiversity conservation and economic valuation of ecosystem services. After these project, I started my Ph.D. in Disaster Mitigation and Management (Top 5 Institute). I am currently in my second year. My research mainly focuses on how farmers are adapting to climate change. 

I'm very much interested in sustainability consulting (sustainable agriculture and climate change adaptation). So, I'm planning to drop my PhD to pursue a Master's degree in Management focusing on Sustainability in Europe. 

1. Is it a right decision?
2. Does this field have future?
3. Is MiM the right program? If not, suggest some.
4. Do I have placement opportunities after I complete MiM?

Also, 2 of the schools you mentioned are in France, one in Germany - do you speak German or French? While classes might be taught in English at the Master's level, it's going to be an uphill experience studying/living there without knowing the language.

Training and degrees have costs (financial costs, and also opportunity costs - i.e., one could be working already instead of getting more training), so they make sense in the context of career / life goals. Do you wish to stay in India, or be able to move to Europe / the West? If the latter, getting a ""local"" European degree might help - but I would caution against the notion of finding jobs easily at all afterward . If you intend to stay in India, it sounds to me like you already have plenty of adequate training and experience. You could also complete your PhD in Disaster Mitigation and Management: it wouldn't be much longer than a new 2-year Master's, and a PhD should be well regarded for jobs in sust./env. consulting.

Given the magnitude of the difference, it would not make sense, would it.  Going car-free contributes less than 50% less than not flying, vs, you know 6300% less.

post,1nvsa3a,,What's the Best Charitable Donation for Climate Change,"Let me start this off by saying there are probably other actions that are more effective for fighting climate change. I see myself as being in a privileged economic situation and  I'm trying to allocate a % of my income towards charitable donations.

When I think about what would be ideal in a charity I gravitate towards hard numbers of what can be proven as an impact. This leads me to think that an ideal donation could be seen as the lowest $/tonn co2 reduced or the highest lifetime amount of co2 equivalent that can be reduced per dollar spent. Ultimately this will be very close to buying carbon offsets. 

I've been thinking about this a bit lately and am wondering if the best way to achieve this would be to ethically reduce future global population by supporting charities focused on women's reproductive health/ family planning, specifically in the right to choose globally. I like this strategy since it seems hard to lose because on its own this is a worthy goal imo.

Even looking at lifetime carbon emissions per person in the least developed countries the numbers are respectable even before you think about how a single birth could cause a future birth. When I very roughly try to look at carbon emissions through this lense I came up with <$15 per tonn co2 avoided. 

I used the United Nations Population Fund as an example for this calculation. This is the 2024 funding, divided by the claimed number of births reduced, divided by the current co2 emissions per year (from some of the lowest countries with the lowest value), divided by the average life expectancy in these same countries. I don't expect this number to be particularly accurate, I do view it as pretty conservative so I thought I'd include it to be debated/ compared against competing donations impacts. 

I guess I'm wondering if there are reputable calcutions charities conduct aiming at the same goals that could be better then mine.

comment,nhadtv3,t3_1nvmumv,What’s left to figure out about climate change?,"The world's climate is a complex system that we have just figured out how it works. It's gonna take a while to figure out exactly how it breaks. We already have a good idea, but the hows and whens and how much and the effects of mediation and mitigation and their  timing and intensity means that it's difficult to predict. We know it when we see it, and we know that randomness will be involved, and most scientists are smart enough to know that they don't know everything (but they're working on it as if their lives depend on it).

So, a tornado in summer in Texas is not a departure from normal, nor is a drought, nor are floods. Those are weather. and we have a long history of weather patterns. We can see the past fairly clearly. In normal circumstances we would predict more of the same with some random stuff thrown in. Now, we can predict overall warming of Texas winters, over time, but we can't predict very well the occasional and anomalous deep freeze winters, which will also occur. We can predict longer and deeper droughts, but there will also be more 100 and 1000 year torrential rainfalls. We just don't know exactly when. Weather forecasting can be pretty accurate at three days, less so at a week out, and reliant on past trends for a month out or more. We can only predict with certainty, that weather will get worse and accelerate worsening over time. And occasionally, we'll have a beautiful lovely summer, and nice normal winter.  

What won't happen, at least not with any certainty, is a massive world wide systems collapse. The world is a big place. A gradual and accelerating process of climactic enshittification is predictable with certainty, though.

Its possible, in the next few decades, for us to cross multiple thresholds and lock in a future hellscape for our descendants, all without us knowing for some time they've been crossed. 

As I understand it (former climate scientist here, but a long time ago now), the physics of tipping points is very complex due to the nonlinear nature of interactions between systems.

How much negative feedback did we get out of the sulfur that used to be in all petroleum based liquid fuels?  What's the worst that could happen if we lean on stratospheric sulfur injection geoengineering?

Carbon dioxide is not the most important greenhouse gas.  Water vapor is; It's just subject to substantial localized negative feedbacks as clouds reflect light.  How does literally everything else that climate change is going to do, impact cloud formation, seeding, and storm intensity?  What fraction of cropland is going to become useless from drought or flood, how often, for how long?

We know that the Sahara used to look more like a monsoon-driven savannah, and so did the Amazon Basin.  Why?  What changed?  Will it happen again?  How fast?

Two, from more of a public policy perspective, how to predict upcoming major events more accurately.  Like for example, how has the collapse of the Conger Ice Shelf contributed to glacial acceleration?  And exactly how big are the glaciers that are going to be sliding into the ocean in the coming years?

How severe will it get?

Then there are the questions about whether it’s too late to mitigate some of the damage. 

Can we switch to a “cleaner” power source to provide the power we want without increasing emissions? 
Can we find a comfortable way to live in the much hotter temperatures?
Will we still be able to produce enough food to feed our society?

The biggest influencer to climate change is volcanic eruptions. However all the research is being directed to what can make profitable bribe/kickback schemes for politicians.

Another problem with the research is that it’s directed to mass solutions that are very profitable for bribed politicians, over micro solutions that would actually work. One region (France?) is taking all their wind turbines down because the net loss is huge. The energy made just doesn’t offset the emissions from manufacturing, transport, installation, maintenance, storage, and disposal of turbines. Any electrician can tell you that the farther electricity travels, the more bleed off you get. With giant turbines, end users are hundreds (thousands?) of miles away, which means huge bleed off.

There's even more to do at a regional level. ENSO is shifting the opposite way compared to model predictions for one, the AMOC is a massive question mark, I'm sure there's loads more systems whose behaviour under climate change is still really uncertain.

Here are the basics of the science:



* CO2 in the atmosphere absorbs IR

* The earth's surface emits IR

* We are currently increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by 6% per decade

* We know the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere is from ancient carbon that we burn by looking at the isotopes of carbon

* We have increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by 50% in the last 150 years

* Current rate of temperature increase over the last 30 years is 2.4 C per century, far faster than natural increase

* Global mean surface temperature is 1.5C warmer than it was 150 years ago

* Over the last 2.5 million years temperatures have not been higher than today

comment,nhb00zy,t1_nha0nww,What’s left to figure out about climate change?,"You can. It's a myth that to stop climate change we'd have to regress a century in quality of life for a lot of things. We just need to stop rampantly increasing consumption and make what we already have more efficient. That alone will be enough.

Every government should have a program to enforce carbon **negative** status. Absorb more emissions than put out. There are a lot of clear ways to do this, one suggestion (can't remember where I heard it) was that if you stagger it by one year it could be fairly effective.

For example, it's the year 2025, you've done your taxes. The government monitors the carbon emissions of your business (create an organization for it.) You report to the government your emissions, and just like the IRS, they check it back and make sure that it's good (maybe something akin to health inspections or whatever on the regular to ensure that they are in line with what they report.) If you're emitting more than you're capturing (and there will be some allowance that counts as ""not emitting"" based on the passive amount the planet and government programs already absorb) they say you have to caputre that AND the amount you've emitted in the year of 2025 by the time you file the next year, OR pay the carbon tax which fuels government programs to capture that carbon.

Something along those lines. Yes, it will slow the economy down. Yes, it will be difficult. But no, it will not prevent us from going on vacations, driving cars, having tvs and game consoles and AC, etc.",_Dingaloo,7,1759375480,02-10-2025 03:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nvmumv/whats_left_to_figure_out_about_climate_change/nhb00zy/

comment,nhac2c6,t1_nha1r90,What’s left to figure out about climate change?,"Briefly, it's a thing where people in general tend to be biased toward what they have past experience with.

This isn't a problem if your circumstances aren't changing very much.  You went to the store for peanut butter last month, you go to the same store for peanut butter this month and when you go to the same aisle as before, there is the peanut butter, just like last time.  No problem right?

But what if there is a massive catastrophic upheaval?  A natural disaster, or space aliens invade or whatever.  The store is destroyed.  Yet when you want peanut butter, you don't know what else to do, so you go to the same place.  Even though it's a washed out silt-inundated ruin, you stand there where the peanut butter aisle used to be, wondering if you might spot some.  And you go back again next week, just to be sure.

Okay that's a bit of a whimsical example.  But you can probably imagine how it can happen in other areas.  Even expert scientists do this sometimes.  Imagine you have spent your life mastering the complexities of some vastly intricate natural system, like, say, the Earth's planetary climate systems.  You hone an intuition for how things work that is accurate and based on deep understanding.  You know where the peanut butter is.

But then something comes along to screw everything up.  Well now everyone wants to talk about global warming.  You are trying to build a model for understanding climate change.  What do you base it on?  Your past experience as an expert of course.  Your model has tons of different parameters that influence how it works, and while many experts will disagree on exactly what are the best values to use for each of those parameters, they will all tend to cluster around the same range of values because that is what they are all used to from working on historical climate modeling all their careers.

The problem is that in the event of a sudden catastrophic change, that intuition might not be valid anymore.  It might not be valid in a highly specific way — it will consistently underestimate the scale of change.  Because it was trained on calmer data from a calmer age.

So this manifests for example as climate models, made by experts who are absolutely the most knowledgable and qualified people out there for making such models, nevertheless totally underestimating actual climate change.  Consistently.  Just because everything is changing so fast, what was normal before, is now no longer a useful guide.

That is normality bias.

And of course it also has a broader application, to all of us, whenever we see something alarming going on but say to ourselves, ""Naah, something like this has never happened before, it's probably nothing this time, I'll just get back to playing Royal Match and not worry about it.""",amitym,2,1759366462,02-10-2025 00:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nvmumv/whats_left_to_figure_out_about_climate_change/nhac2c6/

The Seven Remembrances of a Changing Planet

 

The causes and conditions which support life on Earth are of the nature to change. There may be no way for me to escape the consequences of a changing global climate.

 

The vegetation of Earth is of the nature to die. There may be no way for me to escape the death of crops, forests, and wild ecosystems.

 

The animals and insects of Earth are of a nature to become extinct. There may be no way for me to escape the sixth mass extinction of water, land, underground, and air beings.

 

The seeds of racial and social justice, which are planted to nourish me, other beings, and Earth, may not germinate. There may be no way for me to escape hatred, cruelty, and injustice.

 

Civilizations of Earth are of a nature to die. There may be no way for me to escape the collapse of societal cooperation, communication, and stable food production.

 

My unbroken wholeness, which exists independent of causes and conditions, is my true gift to the world. My ethical actions, rooted in love and self-restraint, are expressions of gratitude toward Mother Earth.

 

Earth, precious jewel of the cosmos, who transcends notions of birth and death, who is not limited by signs of vegetation, animals, justice, and civilizations, is continuing her long journey of beginning anew.

The animals and insects of Earth are of a nature to become extinct. There may be no way for me to escape the sixth mass extinction of water, land, underground, and air beings.

 

The seeds of racial and social justice, which are planted to nourish me, other beings, and Earth, may not germinate. There may be no way for me to escape hatred, cruelty, and injustice.

 

Civilizations of Earth are of a nature to die. There may be no way for me to escape the collapse of societal cooperation, communication, and stable food production.

 

My unbroken wholeness, which exists independent of causes and conditions, is my true gift to the world. My ethical actions, rooted in love and self-restraint, are expressions of gratitude toward Mother Earth.

comment,nhbe9tg,t1_nhb00zy,What’s left to figure out about climate change?,"Your proposed solution assumes that we can simply make the economy “carbon negative” through regulation and efficiency without fundamentally changing how the system works. But the problem is not just emissions—it’s the competitive logic of the global economy itself. Businesses and nations are locked in short-term competition to maximize resources, growth, and profits. Even if a carbon accounting system is enforced, the underlying drive to outcompete rivals pushes actors to cut corners, lobby for exemptions, or externalize costs elsewhere. Efficiency gains don’t decouple growth from resource use; they often accelerate consumption because cheaper, more efficient systems enable more production and demand.

Moreover, tying carbon accountability to yearly offsets still ties action to the same market logic that created the crisis. Carbon “capture” becomes another industry where entities compete to minimize costs, often at the expense of effectiveness, while the economy keeps expanding overall resource extraction. This doesn’t solve the structural issue: that our system is designed to grow endlessly on a finite planet. Slowing down emissions growth is not the same as escaping the growth imperative.

So while such a scheme may sound workable on paper, it risks being another technocratic patch on a system fundamentally geared toward overshoot. Without addressing the root—competition for growth in a finite system—efficiency and regulation alone won’t prevent collapse.",Capable-Performer777,2,1759382164,02-10-2025 05:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nvmumv/whats_left_to_figure_out_about_climate_change/nhbe9tg/

The system has a path for this that we've used for hundreds of other things across the centuries. Taxation. Tax more to disinsentivise certain paths, and if you take that path, now there's more taxes that to some degree help create government programs to clean up the air.

You're right, the global economy part of it is absolutely an issue. But it's not some impossible idea to create some sort of international standard; or some organization that is a collaboration of governments that agrees to a certain quality and method of detecting the emission output/capture of a company. Then, the US can say, if you purchase from a company that doesn't have the ""net neutral"" or ""net negative"" badge, you will be taxed more. Not to say it'll be easy, I'm saying it's doable and we've done much much harder things before.

> tying carbon accountability to yearly offsets still ties action to the same market logic that created the crisis

The thing is, this market logic has overall worked if you ignore the climate impacts. Undeniably it is the best method of wealth creation that we as a society have ever experienced. The issue is spreading the wealth, and climate stuff, of course more but those are the main two and have relevance here. That is a corruption and regulation problem, but it doesn't mean the proposed solution would be ineffective.

If carbon capture is done more efficiently and it is accurately tracked, what's the harm in comparison to other modern history? We **need** carbon capture and reduction methods to be cheaper and more efficient. Whether that's DAC, restoring habitats, planting more trees, etc, we **need** that to be an industry that the market strongly pushes for.

It's much, more more unrealistic to suggest we'll stop the form of economy that has brought us into the modern medicine and digital age than to say we properly regulate it. And why should we even want to prevent a continuous increase of wealth creation if we can manage it on the climate and distribution of wealth side of things?",_Dingaloo,1,1759555401,04-10-2025 05:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nvmumv/whats_left_to_figure_out_about_climate_change/nho7c6j/

post,1numod8,,4 Degrees of Temperature Rise,"The news in the USA should present the two degree climate target as 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit or even “almost 4 degrees.”

Most Americans, sadly, can’t comprehend Celsius, and even for those that do, the actual implication of that rise in temperature probably isn’t registering in their heads as they passively listen to the news. I’m an American who uses Celsius all the time and doesn’t deny climate science, and still 2 degrees just doesn’t sound like much to be honest. It’s not how we think. We need to hear it in units we commonly use. “The global temperature has increased 1.6 degrees.” I think you mean “The Earth is 3 degrees warmer.” Use degrees Fahrenheit, compare the average temperature of cities, measure in football fields, etc. Use freedom units for us dumb Americans. I honestly think the impact is interpreted by Americans as 5/9ths as bad as it is.

comment,nh2cshw,t3_1numod8,4 Degrees of Temperature Rise,"I agree making a conversion might be useful, but that's not the principle problem keeping Americans/etc from internalizing the issue.

The principle issue is that most of the information broadcast out to those still in the ""climate change hoax"" mindset consists of: 



>*so what if it's four degrees warmer? You mean it will be 96 instead of 92 sometimes during summer, or 25 instead of 21 sometimes in winter?*

They generally say something like ""those temperatures are hardly outside survival range, why are we making such a big deal of it?

  
The information being left out is what is important. The ""hoax"" camp people tend to believe they have been given the sum of information and that governments and elites are using this as some sort of backroom excuse to impose \[insert changes to vehicle requirements, building requirements, desired behavioral adjustments, etc\].

What they are *not* given by the ""news"" ecosystem they are embedded in are things such as: warmer air holds more evaporated water, meaning that when it rains there is more rain (and more flooding). Warmer, wetter air has more potential for violence, meaning more hurricanes will gain ""devastating"" categories. Shifting weather patterns mean longer droughts for areas that already have some drought.

What they are not reminded of is: **even if climate change is entirely natural, humans still suffer massive consequences that extend well beyond slightly warmer days**. This is conveniently left out of the information pumped out of the right-wing media ecosystem, so much so that I can only believe the exclusion is intentional and long-running with the intention of creating and cultivating a zeitgeist of denialism in those who routinely consume the material.

The right-wing media ecosystem in the US is remarkably coordinated and well disguised, not to mention deeply incestuous with the religious right which lends an added air of authority to most listeners. And they are large / wide-ranging enough to create a bubble in which people can listen to any number of diverse networks & programs and get similar information, which strengthens the illusion that the reality they describe is actual reality and not a propaganda fantasy. This, in turn, results in a nearly cult-like mindset that proves very difficult to penetrate with actual reality, facts, or meaningful discussion. And this (the ""climate hoax is just propaganda for politicians pushing leftism"") is one of the more visible consequences.",kmoonster,46,1759262179,30-09-2025 19:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1numod8/4_degrees_of_temperature_rise/nh2cshw/

So “+2C” actually translates to a more like +6F to +8F in all the places most of us live, since most of us live on continental land masses.  If you lived out in the middle of the south pacific or something you might see well under than +2C/4F.

For instance, in Central Texas, at + ~1.3-1.5C like we are at now, we have actually *already* risen about +4.4F as of this year in terms of our recorded average temps.  Some of that was increased heat island effect, but you’d get like +4F for rural areas around here too.

comment,nh4swa4,t1_nh468cu,4 Degrees of Temperature Rise,"Whoops - note that I said “6-8*F*” is possible for continental land locations when the total average has come up to ~+4F for the land AND sea average).  +6F or barely more would be about the average expected amount worldwide for land only temps by that point, but a lot of north hemisphere locations where out population is actually disproportionally located would actually likely be more like ~+7F or possibly even +8F.

Texas has actually been in a regional anomaly where it has experienced less of the recent acceleration of warming than most continental locations in the northern hemisphere.  That’s only been for the last 5 years that we’ve usually gotten lucky, probably due to mostly random walk types of variation, and I doubt it means anything.  We’ve still kept warming, but rather than faster than other places, it’s actually been slightly blunted lately.  Probably over time we’ll average out more equal to other regions.  But I used it as an example because it has already experienced a little over the full +4F shift you wanted about in your OP.  In Austin where I live, we’re up a full 4.4F on average since just 1979, and a little more since true long term historical baseline.  Again, some of that here is urban heat island effects, but +4F is common over that same period in our rural locations.  By the time the worldwide average is +2C, I’d expect we’ll have gained a couple more degrees Fahrenheit.

# Summary: A Million Ponds Across Pakistan

This article proposes a large-scale water storage initiative to address Pakistan's severe water crisis through the construction of one million small ponds across the country.

## The Problem

Pakistan faces acute water scarcity despite being in the Indus River Basin. Key challenges include:

- Fourth highest water usage rate globally, with the highest water intensity rate per unit of GDP
- 97% of surface water consumed by agriculture using inefficient flood irrigation
- Ranked among the top 10 countries most vulnerable to climate change
- 88 million people (39.2% of population) living below the poverty line
- Outdated water infrastructure causing high losses
- Three-quarters of the country receives less than 250mm of rain annually

## Historical Context

The article traces South Asia's long history of pond-based water storage systems, from ancient gabarbands in Balochistan to extensive tank networks in India and Sri Lanka, where over 15,000 ponds have been constructed over centuries.

## The Solution: Million Ponds Tabdeeli

The Hisaar Foundation proposes constructing one million ponds over three years, categorized by water source (spring, seepage, rain-fed, flood-fed) and size:

- **Small ponds**: 20,000 litres capacity
- **Large ponds**: 50,000 litres capacity
- **Average capacity**: 35,000 litres filling 30 days yearly
- Each pond could serve approximately 57 people at 50 litres per person daily

## Expected Impact

- Benefit 58 million people (66% of those below poverty line)
- Provide water for drinking, domestic use, farming and livestock
- Create jobs and increase agricultural productivity
- Align with National Water Policy objectives
- Cost-effective, low-tech green infrastructure

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1** (Pilot): 1,000 ponds across 11 districts in all provinces, targeting the poorest areas

#Pakistan pins big hopes on small dams to help farmers beat drought

Source(s): Thomson Reuters Foundation, trust.org

By Imran Mukhtar

*A project, led by Sindh's provincial government, is helping farmers in drought-hit areas harvest rainwater using small dams, enabling them to earn more from their land*

ISLAMABAD - For years, Nangji Mal struggled to scrape together a living growing pulses and pearl millet on his farm in Nagarparkar, a desert area in Pakistan's southeastern Sindh province.

But these days his land is lush and fertile, after the government constructed new water-harvesting dams nearby.

Using irrigation water from one of the small dams, Mal is growing onions, wheat and other crops on his 40-acre (16-ha) plot and says he has seen his income increase more than 60%.

""It had never occurred to me that I might be able, in my lifetime, to earn a handsome amount from my fields, but this reservoir has made it all possible,"" Mal, 59, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Pakistan, a nation of about 220 million people, faces increasing water scarcity driven by worsening climate-related drought and an agriculture industry that is pushing itself to meet the demands of a growing population, say water experts.

Less than 20% of the water the country's farmers use for irrigation is captured rainwater, with most coming from ground and surface water, according to a paper published in 2020 by a group of agricultural and environmental researchers.

The Sindh provincial government hopes the new rainwater harvesting dams will not only provide farmers with a reliable water supply but also help recharge groundwater levels, as some of the water from the dams sinks into the earth, said Murtaza Wahab, environment adviser to the chief minister of Sindh.

Since construction started six years ago, the provincial government has built 60 small rainwater-fed dams - each with an average storage capacity of 100,000 gallons - in the remote drought-hit areas of Nagarparkar and Kohistan, Wahab added.

The plan is to build at least 23 more in the next two or three years, he said.

Wahab noted that because those areas have such scattered populations, there are no reliable figures on how many people are benefiting from the new dams.

Mal said the dam in his area has transformed his farm, as he can now use water from it year-round to irrigate his crops.

In Tharparkar, the district where Mal's farm is located, the average annual rainfall can be as low as 9mm (0.35 inches) and the area frequently experiences drought, according to international charity WaterAid.

""(Before) my farming was on a very small scale, really not enough to meet my expenses, as it was all dependent on only rainwater throughout the year,"" the farmer said.

#Better Livelihoods
The State Bank of Pakistan noted in its annual report for 2016-17 that the country's water supply was both limited and erratic, while demand was rising rapidly due to a growing population and increasing urbanisation.

""The resulting imbalance is pushing the country towards severe water shortage,"" the report stated.

According to its latest economic survey, Pakistan had about 94 million acre feet of surface water available for agriculture during the financial year 2019-20 - a nearly 10% shortfall compared to how much the sector uses on average every year.

Wahab, the government adviser, said the small dams had been a boon to the farmers using them, noting that last year Nagarparkar's onion farmers reported a total yield worth 600 million rupees ($3.75 million), a record for Sindh province.

""The dams have a long-term benefit for the local population, because when abundant water is available in these water-scarce areas, people will bring more barren land under cultivation and the number of their livestock will start increasing,"" he said.

Besides the Sindh government's project, the federal government has also allocated 20.4 billion rupees to build more than 500 small dams across the country, said Ghazala Channar, deputy chief of water resources in the Ministry of Planning.

The new reservoirs will help mitigate floods, ease poverty and develop agriculture, as well as increasing the water table and providing clean drinking water, she added.

""Access to more water will boost the agricultural economy ... and thus provide more jobs to people, not only in the sector but also in all areas that are directly or indirectly linked with farming,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

#Careful Use
Water experts warn, however, that small dams are not a silver bullet for arid parts of the country.

Daanish Mustafa, professor of critical geography at King's College London, said using small dams to recharge groundwater supplies only works in freshwater zones.

The rainwater caught by the dams is not much use in topping up the water table in areas like Sindh, where 80% of the underground water supply is saline, he explained.

Instead, Mustafa said, the provincial and federal governments should stop subsidising the electricity commercial farms use to run large tube-wells, which are a major cause of depleting underground water levels.

The authorities also need to help farmers adapt to the water supply they have now, he said, adding that those in drought-prone areas should learn to grow less thirsty crops.

The cultivation of rice and sugarcane, which need more water, should be discouraged in Sindh, he added.

Mal agreed that he and the thousands of other farmers in his area who use the small dams still need to be careful with how much water they use.

Yet despite criticisms of the project, finally having a reliable water source has changed his life, he said.

""I am no more an unlucky person, because I'm earning enough from my fields to make ends meet,"" he said.",Economy-Fee5830,1,1759337962,01-10-2025 16:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nuaut0/as_floods_worsen_pakistan_is_the_epicenter_of/nh7rn1b/

Less than 20% of the water the country's farmers use for irrigation is captured rainwater, with most coming from ground and surface water, according to a paper published in 2020 by a group of agricultural and environmental researchers.

The Sindh provincial government hopes the new rainwater harvesting dams will not only provide farmers with a reliable water supply but also help recharge groundwater levels, as some of the water from the dams sinks into the earth, said Murtaza Wahab, environment adviser to the chief minister of Sindh.

Since construction started six years ago, the provincial government has built 60 small rainwater-fed dams - each with an average storage capacity of 100,000 gallons - in the remote drought-hit areas of Nagarparkar and Kohistan, Wahab added.

(this is [100,000 gallons](https://40800710.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bolted-steel-tanks-product-image-03-43.jpg) btw )

The plan is to build at least 23 more in the next two or three years, he said.

Wahab noted that because those areas have such scattered populations, there are no reliable figures on how many people are benefiting from the new dams.

Mal said the dam in his area has transformed his farm, as he can now use water from it year-round to irrigate his crops.

In Tharparkar, the district where Mal's farm is located, the average annual rainfall can be as low as 9mm (0.35 inches) and the area frequently experiences drought, according to international charity WaterAid.

""(Before) my farming was on a very small scale, really not enough to meet my expenses, as it was all dependent on only rainwater throughout the year,"" the farmer said.

Better Livelihoods
The State Bank of Pakistan noted in its annual report for 2016-17 that the country's water supply was both limited and erratic, while demand was rising rapidly due to a growing population and increasing urbanisation.

""The resulting imbalance is pushing the country towards severe water shortage,"" the report stated.

According to its latest economic survey, Pakistan had about 94 million acre feet of surface water available for agriculture during the financial year 2019-20 - a nearly 10% shortfall compared to how much the sector uses on average every year.

**Wahab, the government adviser, said the small dams had been a boon to the farmers using them, noting that last year Nagarparkar's onion farmers reported a total yield worth 600 million rupees ($3.75 million), a record for Sindh province.**

""The dams have a long-term benefit for the local population, because when abundant water is available in these water-scarce areas, people will bring more barren land under cultivation and the number of their livestock will start increasing,"" he said.

Besides the Sindh government's project, the federal government has also allocated 20.4 billion rupees to build more than 500 small dams across the country, said Ghazala Channar, deputy chief of water resources in the Ministry of Planning.

The new reservoirs will help mitigate floods, ease poverty and develop agriculture, as well as increasing the water table and providing clean drinking water, she added.",Economy-Fee5830,1,1759350157,01-10-2025 20:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nuaut0/as_floods_worsen_pakistan_is_the_epicenter_of/nh8y9lf/

>In addition to having relatively little overall freshwater in proportion to demands, Syria, like the region as a whole, experiences high natural hydrologic variability. Over the past century (from 1900 to 2005), there were six significant droughts in Syria, where the average monthly level of winter precipitation—the major rainfall season—dropped to around one-third of normal. Five of these droughts lasted only one season; the sixth lasted two (Mohtadi 2013). Starting in 2006, however, and lasting into 2011, Syria experienced a multiseason, multiyear period of extreme drought that contributed to agricultural failures, economic dislocations, and population displacement (Worth 2010). This dry period has continued and is now being described as the “worst long-term drought and most severe set of crop failures since agricultural civilizations began in the Fertile Crescent many millennia ago” [Gary Nabhan, as cited by Femia and Werrell (2012)].



> which said water scarcity contributed to the economic issues which followed conflict.

The drought was from 2006 to 2011, the conflict started in **December 2011**.  So you, again, are wrong



My paper says this, which is not what you claim

>The Syrian conflict that began in 2012 has many roots, including long-standing political, religious, and social ideological disputes; economic dislocations from both global and regional factors; and worsening environmental conditions. This paper argues that key environmental factors include both direct and indirect consequences of water shortages, ineffective watershed management, and the impacts of climate variability and change on regional hydrology. **Severe multiyear drought beginning in the mid-2000s, combined with inefficient and often unmodernized irrigation systems and water abstractions by other parties in the eastern Mediterranean, including especially Syria, contributed to the displacement of large populations from rural to urban centers, food insecurity for more than a million people, and increased unemployment—with subsequent effects on political stability.** There is some evidence that the recent drought is an early indicator of the climatic changes that are expected for the region, including higher temperature, decreased basin rainfall and runoff, and increased water scarcity. Absent any efforts to address population growth rates, these water-related factors are likely to produce even greater risks of local and regional political instability, unless other mechanisms for reducing water insecurity can be identified and implemented. In the region as a whole, new dam construction, growing water withdrawals, and limited political cooperation on water issues may become even more important in coming years. Among the key options available to policy makers are improvements in water-use efficiency and productivity in agriculture, better management and monitoring of groundwater resources, and comprehensive international agreements on managing and sharing the rivers that cross political borders.

> For proponents of the view that anthropogenic climate change will become a ‘threat multiplier’ for instability in the decades ahead, the Syrian civil war has become a recurring reference point, providing apparently compelling evidence that such conflict effects are already with us. According to this view, human-induced climatic change was a contributory factor in the extreme drought experienced within Syria prior to its civil war; this drought in turn led to large-scale migration; and this migration in turn exacerbated the socio-economic stresses that underpinned Syria's descent into war. This article provides a systematic interrogation of these claims, and finds little merit to them. Amongst other things it shows that there is no clear and reliable evidence that anthropogenic climate change was a factor in Syria's pre-civil war drought; that this drought did not cause anywhere near the scale of migration that is often alleged; and that there exists no solid evidence that drought migration pressures in Syria contributed to civil war onset. The Syria case, the article finds, does not support ‘threat multiplier’ views of the impacts of climate change; to the contrary, we conclude, policymakers, commentators and scholars alike should exercise far greater caution when drawing such linkages or when securitising climate change.

Wildfire-induced thunderstorms, called *pyrocumulonimbus clouds (pyroCbs)*, can inject huge amounts of smoke and moisture into the upper atmosphere, where they may disrupt ozone and influence climate.

For the first time, a global climate model successfully simulated these extreme wildfire storms, reproducing the 2020 Creek Fire pyroCb in California and validating the method with the 2021 Dixie Fire. This breakthrough opens the door to studying how extreme wildfires shape Earth’s atmosphere and climate.

What my lecturer and other studies have found is that growing plants in increased CO2 increases the amount cellulose, but doesn't change the uptake of other nutrients, so you end up with more cellulose per nutrient. The major implication of this is that it means per weight plants will become less nutritious as CO2 increases, and so herbivores and humans will have to eat more plants in order to get the same amount of nutrition. This has ecological and human health impacts as you can imagine. In some of these studies they experimented with both increased CO2 and increased temperature and still replicated the results with increased temperature. It is obviously possible that climate change could somehow make water soluble nutrients more available, but in these studies, they found no evidence of that.

REGENERATION: ENDING THE CLIMATE CRISIS IN ONE GENERATION

Paul Hawken has been working in the climate solutions space since the 1990s. He founded **Project Drawdown in 2014** to quantify today's global, commercial solutions.  He then founded **Project Regeneration in 2021**, to provide science-based action options for individuals, communities, SMEs and regions.  The Project Regeneration Action Nexus has over 80 solutions areas with a wealth of action options (which are regularly updated)

In my observation, there's limited value in trying to win arguments in words about ""the truth"".   The most fervent sceptic in my circle drives an EV for its high performance, technology and ease  PLUS runs a massive solar panel/battery installation because he values the independence and cost savings.

If you spend your time taking action on your pick of today's hundreds of high-impact commercial regenerative solutions, then you'll be able to have conversations about the fun you're having, the impact you're making, and the benefits that regenerative innovation is delivering to your life/career/business/community today.",ThinkActRegenerate,2,1759202812,30-09-2025 03:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1ntjr13/common_climate_denial_tactic/ngy4mwy/

So there is that.

""climate change is supposedly a good thing or at least not bad or exaggerated. ""

Climate change is a reality that has always existed on this planet.  There is no normal climate or normal temperature.  Period.  

The question is whether the climate has warmed faster recently than periods in our past.

The question is what part of recent warming is caused by natural changes and what part is caused by anthropogenic CO2/Methane.

We have limited data on events like hurricanes, although current data shows no increase in intensity or frequency.

Floods.  Show me a river system that has not been changed by man and you could possible answer that question.

Droughts.  No empirical evidence they are more prevalent now than it the past.  Note. if you put millions of people in deserts like we have in the SouthWest then even marginal changes in the watershed turn into major disasters in the making.  That is on us.

The data is shit.  Undeniable.  We don't have accurate data that extends back much past the 1940's.  I think there was one weather station in South America up until the late 1930's.  Asia, none, same in Africa.  Then there are the time of day calculations etc.  Like I said, shit.  

Ocean data, which is 3/4 of the planet is worse.  Ship engine inlets with no standardization and limited to shipping lanes.  It wasn't until the 2006 with the ARGO floats that we saw any real data at all.  

We do have proxy data.  Until as Michael Mann found out, we don't.  It's okay and gives broad stroke ideas of what the past looked like but to tenths of a degree?  Really?  

It's science not politics or at least it should be.  The scientific method, the golden rule, does not make any allowances for consensus or debate.  Does the evidence support the hypothesis or not?  

Denier or supporter are just made up things that usually track back to politics, power and most of all money.  People need to be smarter.",j2nh,0,1759166324,29-09-2025 17:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1ntjr13/common_climate_denial_tactic/nguz7fh/

comment,nguxuln,t1_ngumeg8,Common climate denial tactic.,"I’ll get huge flack for this…but chat gpt (in *quotes* below) helped me out a little and I think answers well. From 2000 to 2025 there had been a measurable ~10 cm of rise. Not noticeable from satellites. If the trend continues, and there is no acceleration, by 2050 it’ll be another 10  cm of rise:

*”So, if the recent linear rate simply continued unchanged for 25 years, global mean sea level would rise by roughly 9–11 cm (about 3.5–4.4 inches) by 2050 relative to today.”*

*”Locally: that extra ~10 cm increases the frequency and height of coastal flooding events (high tides, storm surges). Places already close to critical thresholds (low-lying streets, basements, sewer outfalls) see many more “nuisance”: or “sunny-day” floods. Infrastructure (roads, drainage, groundwater intrusion into wells, saltwater contamination of soils) is affected well before you see wholesale loss of land.*”

So without acceleration, sea level rise sucks, but it isn’t catastrophic by 2050, and could likely be mitigated by further sea walls and pumping. Which realistically is the path most communities are planning for. They know they need to invest in projects to mitigate the effects of rising sea level. 

Now, if the rate of rise changes, it’s quickly easy to see how big of a deal it could become by 2050. The answer I give to most people is they are absolutely right, there has been hardly any noticeable change from photos in the last 25 years, but there is full evidence that indeed the sea level is rising, and this rate of change is not slowing…and honestly all evidence is the rate of change will increase. 

The effects of this continued rise are straight forward enough…we need to spend more on sea walls and pumping. Storm surges from hurricane can get more and more devastating. A 1 m difference in base sea level elevation is devastating when you consider that the coast line is mostly flat for miles inland, so any difference is felt significantly. People don’t understand that the sea continues underground, and many fresh water aquifers could get contaminated with salt water. Salt water reacts different with metal and concrete that was designed for fresh water. If the salt water ground water increases inland, foundations to buildings could be impacted in a big way. 

It’s not ideal, and is coming for our coastal cities…however I am not entirely convinced that sea level rise, alone, spells the end for us. Harder times, but in and of itself I don’t believe sea level rise will be so catastrophic that it ruins humanity.",squailtaint,1,1759165940,29-09-2025 17:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1ntjr13/common_climate_denial_tactic/nguxuln/

Now, it is possible that in the future we could see a plateau in crop yields followed by a decline. We could see a future climate that is more inhospitable to plant growth. Nobody can predict the future. But we know that current trends do not indicate the peril you warn about. Adaptation seems to matter more than the changes in climate that we can measure.

The data is high quality because Hawaii is in the tropics without seasonal variation in temperature, and Hawaii is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean without upwind emissions distorting the CO2 measurement.

Nope, it is warming at the surface, which causes warming (to a lesser extent) at depths of 700 meters, about 0.2C per century below 700 meters, sea surface temperatures are rising over 4 times faster.

We know that CO2 is from the burning of ancient carbon by looking at the isotopes of carbon in the CO2 in the atmosphere.  We add 38 trillion of CO2 to the atmosphere each year, subtracting the amount sequestered by natural systems, that amount causes an increase of 2.5 ppm per year.  7.87 trillion kg of CO2 is a 1 ppm increase in atmospheric CO2.

comment,ngw8odz,t1_ngw0gjj,Common climate denial tactic.,"I didn't make any claim about ""why"" annual crop yields are currently increasing, I only claimed that they are increasing, which is correct. My suspicion is that the increase is mostly due to improved farming practices and improved technology, and perhaps secondarily due to increased C02 concentration in the atmosphere. 

It is unabiguously true that increasing C02 concentration around any plant from the current atmospheric concentration to one that is marginally higher (for example 10%-70%) is beneficial to plant growth in terms of size and speed. This has long been demonstrated in labs, it is regularly done in greenhouses, and is very basic science (remember C02=plant food). Of course, there are limits to this (ex: 10,000% increase in C02 concentration would be too much and would likely kill the plants) and there can be other drawbacks as well (slight decrease in nutrient density). But if we are talking about plant growth, which we are, it is absolutely correct to say that an increase in C02 concentration causes plants to grow more and this remains true between the current C02 concentration and one that is at least twice the current concentration, possibly up to 3x the current concentration.

No, CO2 levels **increase** when we leave glacials. There are three different uses for that term and can refer to glacials, the Quaternary glaciation, and the Late Cenozoic Ice Age. We are still in the latter two.  CO2 levels in glacials are about 180 to 190 ppm, and CO2 levels in interglacials are about 280 to 300 ppm

Why do you think it is misguided?

* CO2 in the atmosphere absorbs IR

* The earth's surface emits IR

* We are currently increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by 6% per decade

* We have increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by 50% in the last 150 years

Tree rings are created exactly once per year in trees outside of the tropics, so it's definitely possible to get precise readings for specific years.

Grasses are outcompeted by broad leaf plants when CO2 is above 500 ppm, most of our staple crops are grasses.

Grasses became dominant ecosystems when CO2 fell below 500 ppm

Nutritional density decreases with rising CO2

While increased CO2 can be beneficial it depends on leaf temperature being below 40C and sufficient water for growth

Most food growing regions will become more arid with temperatures above 5C warmer than today

In an area with lots of vegetation that buffers the temp until it gets mowed, just before a drought that kills the buffering effect. Few years ago we had a record local temp. that was all over the regional press. Turns out it was from the thermometer next to the runway of the recently expanded international airport whose traffic had doubled in 20 years. That bit wasn't widely reported. A few other records I've checked over the years also had some let's say non-climatic contributions.

>How does that affect temperature measurement at a ground station

Slight shift in prevalent wind direction can mean the air is coming from over water instead of over land for example, or it's moved into the lee of a hill. The natural shifts in jet steam or Hadley cells could EMA that instead of getting mostly the southern edge of depressions a locality gets more central winds from the depressions. Weather broadly comes in latitudinal bands that can shift longitudinally.

comment,ngv5hfe,t1_ngv4fkn,Common climate denial tactic.,">Why does C02 rise again ? Plant life you say ?

No I didn't say that at all.  CO2 increases in the transition from glacial to interglacials because water holds less CO2 as temperature increases, which increases that amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.

You said this:

>as we exited the last ICE age atmospheric C02 levels almost fell to critical 

That is completely wrong CO2 **increased** as we exited the last ice age.

Edit: here is a graph of leaving the last glacial

>C02 follows temperature, not the other way around

Here's how it worked in the past:

Orbital Trigger: A Milankovitch cycle causes a slight increase in solar energy reaching the poles.

Initial Warming: This leads to initial, modest warming, enough to start melting ice sheets.

CO2 Release: This initial warming then causes the oceans to release CO2 (because warmer water holds less gas). It also thaws permafrost, releasing other greenhouse gases.

Amplification (The Crucial Part): The released CO2 (and other gases) now acts as a powerful amplifier. It traps more heat, causing more warming, which in turn releases more CO2, and so on.

Glacial Termination: This positive feedback loop is responsible for about 80-90% of the total warming that brings the planet out of an ice age.",Infamous_Employer_85,3,1759168088,29-09-2025 17:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1ntjr13/common_climate_denial_tactic/ngv5hfe/

More water in the atmosphere is caused by increased evaporation, which lowers soil moisture.

That is incorrect.  The earth is an oblate sphere, that amount of new land that would be suitable would decrease, for example, about half of Canada is not suitable for agriculture.

We could ""measure"" temperature by computing it from ice cream sales. The path from what satellites actually measure to temp is very complicated.

During previous glacial and interglacial cycles the initial trigger was orbital. CO2 was a feedback that amplified the change.

We're already seeing effects that weren't supposed to happen for a couple of decades at least. I live in california - we haven't had a ""normal"" winter in a while, we've had enough rain to fill the reservoirs so technically we aren't in a drought but the weather patterns seem to have changed. More wildfires, record droughts (and then floods), more intense hurricanes, the list goes on. What was predicted was that weather events would be more extreme, events that would normally only happen once a century would start happening much more frequently and that has been happening.

The west is basically drying out and that has been happening too. The ""normal"" has shifted, what was once a normal snowpack has become extraordinary, what was once and abnormally dry year is the new normal. Twice in the last decade there was essentially no snow on the sierras at christmastime, in previous decades this was not normal. But it probably will be now. One wet year like last year does not offset the increasing number dry years. The rain and snow we do get tends to be later in the season and is typically more rain than snow (bad for CA, our reservoir system is designed to capture snowmelt, not rain).",kwallio,13,1759117149,29-09-2025 03:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nt7bey/how_long_realistically_till_global_warning_will/ngrqtde/

comment,ngroh6c,t3_1nt7bey,How long realistically till global warning will take a big impact on the earth ?,"Depends entirely on your definition of ""big impact"" and perspective, on one hand many ecosystems are already in clear decline, water shortages are becoming a world wide phenomenon and water wars are already brewing, wars that will inevitably lead to further greenhouse output.


On the other hand, it will take hundreds of years for places like antarctica to become ice free, sea level rise is only going to effect smaller poorer populations on islands and a few low lying city's without the funds to build adequate levee's, probably wont be a major problem for most people until 2100+.


One could argue it is big now or that it will be in 75 years and both arguments would be correct, but I suspect world wide famine and war is probably going to catch up with us sooner rather than later and accelerate everything whilst also being a ""big impact"" in and of itself.

It's not some sudden, cinematic phase transition where all the ice melts in two weeks.  It's just a gradual, slight annual escalation in sea levels, in temperatures, in unprecedented weather patterns, in extreme tropical cyclones, in summer heat waves.

I can’t remember the last time a bug exploded on my car windscreen. When i passed my driving test decades ago couldn’t drive a mile without full washer bottles, even 10 summers ago would need to routinely scrape my window. 
Now, nothing, over the entire summer. 

Biodiversity is rapidly declining, far less bird song noticeable because of food source scarcity. Sure some will blame solely pesticide use etc, anything to not take responsibility, as usual it’s not just one isolated thing, it’s a combination. 
Nature can’t keep up with the rate of change. 

Summer this year was Mediterranean-like nearly all summer, uncharacteristically warm even now. 
We have less rainfall and when it rains we get deluges, drains and gutters over flow consistently, same for the storm drains. Clearly nothing to do with a warmer atmosphere holds more water etc. 
Winters now little to no snow, if it does it’s got no persistence. 
Crops failing to grow where they always used to consistently. 
Plants budding out of season and seasons are less defined.

For me (just my opinion) it will take a significant crop failure. If the major wheat producers suffer a catastrophe due to excessive heat and drought they cannot manage, then we will know about it. The western world will likely be ""OK"" becuase we can afford to pay more than the developing world for our food. However the famine in the developing world will likely lead to armed conflict over food or even water.

The first year I lived here, I was in Bismarck and we had about 5-6 months of winter- that was around 2012. I remember loving how much snow there was and reveled in how long winter lasted. Snow for half the year, can you imagine! Well, fast forward to now and it's been 90° for the last 2-3 days, and we are looking at temps in the high 80s the rest of the week. We didn't get snowfall until almost Christmas the last two years in ND, and the season has been much more mild. I grew up in Nebraska, and we had snowfall every year as a kid. Winter storms would shut down school at least 3 or 4 times a season. I remember the big salt trucks rolling down the streets and how fun winter was. It lasted pretty regularly from late November to March. We would drive to Sioux Falls to visit family for Thanksgiving, and there were some years we couldn't make it due to the snow storms passing through. Omaha hasn't had snow I think in the last 2-3 years, if not longer. Climate change is HERE. Actively. The impacts are happening every day whether we notice them immediately or not.

There is a real issue, but the attempt to increase public awareness of it through what can be argued as exaggerated fear mongering has done more harm than good, in my opinion. 


Cyclic weather patterns over centuries, modern Forest fire mitigation, and other glossed over aspects all have significant contributions to this.  And the gradual TREND of climate changes or the rapidity of the change in the trend is where the real concern exists.

Here are the basics of the science:



* CO2 in the atmosphere absorbs IR

* The earth's surface emits IR

* We are currently increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by 6% per decade

* We know the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere is from ancient carbon that we burn by looking at the isotopes of carbon

* We have increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by 50% in the last 150 years

* Current rate of temperature increase over the last 30 years is 2.4 C per century, far faster than natural increase

* Global mean surface temperature is 1.5C warmer than it was 150 years ago

* Over the last 2.5 million years temperatures have not been higher than today

* Atmospheric CO2 is now higher than the last 15 million years.

An extract for you:
> The average temperature of the Earth’s surface is now between 1.34°C and 1.41°C warmer than it was in the late 1800s-prior to the industrial revolution-and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2015-2024) was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.

That goes back before human civilization, admittedly hominids were around, but i think going back to substantially before we as a species had started to be anything other than ""just another animal"" is a decent timeframe.

My sincere apologies if my tone conveyed disrespect. I had intended to trigger discussion. Whatever my intentions, I see that you are correct; I was dooming and thus violating rule 6. I humbly request to not be banned, and will attempt to refrain from doing so here again. Yet if you choose to ban me, I understand, and appreciate your moderation. (I am not being sarcastic, this is what I sound like).

I will again state that I am looking for someone to tell me why my fear is unlikely. I do not think I am misrepresenting the data. The arctic is warming faster than other parts of the planet. We have underestimated the rapidity. We may be underestimating the impacts. The jet stream is weakening, slowing, and growing more wavey. Forecasts predict these trends to intensify. Much of the land we grow crops in are shifting from long standing consistent weather to newly unpredictable weather patterns, and crop failure is an outcome that we may see as the result. We could debate how likely that is to happen and how soon (I tried to trigger that discussion, albeit poorly). Yet it is fair to counter that the data has not led to scientific consensus to that conclusion. So your counter that it is unlikely, is met by my relatively under-informed claim that it is likely. We could also debate when it might happen.

Still, whether or not it happens, or when, does not address the actual issue in this conversational thread. Many people all brought up the same retort to OP's use of the words ""big impact"", by asking ""what do you count as 'big' and as an 'impact'?"" And I stood firm and answered that it is crop failure. Crop failure is THE big impact that people are secretly talking about.  I am speaking against the unspoken argument of alternative claims that a big impact might be coral reef die off, species extinction, large numbers of people dying in wet bulb temperatures, a blue ocean event, measurable air temperature changes, etc etc. Any number of things that could be labeled as ""big impact"" I counter are not. I am positing that the one thing that someone like OP really means is crop shortages. That is when it will hit home. And that is not a scientific argument. And I am contending that it will happen. Weather induced crop shortages are coming. And I will grant that we can increase yields and do things about it. And I will accept that stating it is coming may count as doomerism. 

I think the most pressing conversation we should be having anywhere is how do we manage a large crop breakdown in the near future? Along with it, I am interested in how we stabilize crop prices, and policy towards that end. If we pursued that path, I think the ""big impact"" of climate change would come much later than sooner, and I think OP didn't really mean ""when"" but ""what do we do?"". I answered him with fear and doomerism, not hope and pragmatism.",mahdroo,1,1759184241,29-09-2025 22:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nt7bey/how_long_realistically_till_global_warning_will/ngwohoz/

comment,ngwsc9e,t1_ngwohoz,How long realistically till global warning will take a big impact on the earth ?,"Thank you for your response. As mentioned earlier, crop failures which result in global food shortages are extremely unlikely for the following reasons:

1)  We massively overproduce food, so even a 20% fall in yields, which is massive, would not result in actual calorie shortages, just higher prices.

2) We have a large number of breadbaskets (at least 7) which means it is very unlikely for many areas to be affected at the same time e.g. a disturbance in the Northern hemisphere will leave Brazil and Australia untouched, two burgeoning breadbaskets.

3) Weather systems tend to be anti-correlated - drought in one area results in abundant water in the next.

4) When weather becomes variable, national stockpiles increase to account for it - USA, Europe, China and India for example all have very large stockpiles of staple foods, so even a global bad harvest is not going to kill millions.

5) climate change actually benefits some crops, like rice, which feeds nearly half the world.

6) Agronomists are constantly working to develop more climate-resilient varieties of crops and with good success, and there are also alternative crops which are more drought resistant such as millet or sorghum. 

7) if worst comes to worst, we can feed people before we feed animals, which would again free up abundant calories.

So as you can see, there are a very large number of levers that can be pulled before billions or even millions die from famine - the main reason people die from famine is due to conflict preventing food from reaching them, not due to an absolute shortage of food.",Economy-Fee5830,2,1759185552,29-09-2025 22:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nt7bey/how_long_realistically_till_global_warning_will/ngwsc9e/

Like others have mentioned, it is true that the climate undergoes natural cycles primarily related to earth's orbit and tilt. However, the climate has been quite stable for the last 10,000 years and would have continued to be stable if it weren't for greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests (primarily for animal agriculture). The rate of increase we've seen in the last \~100 years is without precedent in the time that humans have existed and is unequivocally caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. 

Some useful resources:

The NASA climate change page (I'm linking an archived version because many climate change resources hosted by the US government have been taken down or modified since the beginning of the Trump administration): [https://web.archive.org/web/20250101060557/https://climate.nasa.gov/%C2%A0%C2%A0/](https://web.archive.org/web/20250101060557/https://climate.nasa.gov/%C2%A0%C2%A0/)

Chapter 2 covers the natural controls of climate variability and chapter 3 presents our understanding of how humans have impacted the climate.

All the best on what I hope is a valuable journey of understanding. I was taught young earth creationism as opposed to evolution.

I am a scientist who has studied this formally, and I know plenty of climate researchers.  

There is wide agreement across a range of fields of science about this.  The dramatic recent upswing of worldwide temperatures is very clearly almost entirely the result of human actions.  We have the physics and chemistry of how this works solidly understood.  

We also have a good understanding of just how jarringly fast this is all changing.  The earth’s climate has changed before, and been much hotter than today many millions of years ago.  However, it usually changes over tens of thousands of years to change as much as it has in just the last 50(!), and millions of years to change as much as it looks like we will accomplish over a century or so.

On top of all this, biological systems mostly cannot healthily adapt to change this fast.  We are seeing incredible carnage in the natural world just from the changes so far, and it is only going to get worse as we warm further.  Other than a couple specific catastrophes like the asteroid impact that doomed the dinosaurs, we aren’t aware of any times that the climate has changed this quickly.

comment,ngre8lg,t3_1nt58pw,How much of global warming is actually caused by humans?,"Listen pal, you seem to be a good kid so I am going to give you a thorough explanation.

Basically, climate change is due to global warming (an increase in the global temperature) caused by an increase in greenhouse gases (mainly CO₂, but CH₄, and NO₂ Aalso), this will cause disruption of the climate during this century (and for a long time afterwards) leading to various effects (such as drougths, hurricanes, floodings and its related geopolitical effects)

It is unequivocally caused by humans, this has been proved for a long time since the 80's, these sugar-coating affirmations by your textbooks are likely a continuation of a well-documented denialist campaign that has been continously funded by fossil fuel companies. Some of the reasons are:

1. **The isotopic fingerprint (The undeniable proof):**  Fossil fuels  are the remains of ancient plants (that prefer carbon-12 for photosynthesis)that underwent long periods of geological transformations, being chemically carbon rich. When we burn them, we release a massive amount of CO₂ , not any CO₂, the carbon dioxide containing  C12 Isotope. When we measure the ratio of C12 to the ratio of C13, scientists have observed a steady decrease in the proportion of 13C, exactly mirroring the increase in CO₂. This changing isotopic ratio is the smoking gun  that the extra CO₂ is coming from ancient sources (coal, oil, and gas) and not from natural sources such as vulcanos.
2. **It's not the sun:**  The trophosphre  (the lowest layer of the atmosphere) is warming while the stratosphere (layer above) is cooling. If it were the sun we would expect that both would warm, however as CO2 is acting as a greenhouse gas, the trophosphere is warming more than the stratosphere. Also the sun has been slightly decreasing its activity....
3. **The sheer quantity:** Current Carbon dioxide levels are around 420 ppm, the highest earth experienced in the last 800.000 years were around 300 ppm, furthermore these changes happened in the last two centuries (!!), while the previous changes in concentration and temperature were much more gradual.
4. **The  speed (it's not cycles):** Previous temperature changes occur in the tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of  years. As said previously, the planets temperature increased dramatically in less than two hundred years.",Yaldabaoth-Saklas,8,1759112302,29-09-2025 02:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nt58pw/how_much_of_global_warming_is_actually_caused_by/ngre8lg/

comment,ngrljea,t3_1nt58pw,How much of global warming is actually caused by humans?,"That’s a great question, and it’s smart of you to want to check what you’re being told instead of just accepting it. Here’s a clear way to think about it:

1. Yes, it is true that the Earth’s climate has always been changing, but scientists already take that into account.

Technically, it is true that Earth has gone through ice ages and warm periods long before humans existed. Those changes happened because of natural factors in God's design, like:

Shifts in Earth’s orbit and tilt (Milankovitch cycles)

Changes in solar activity

Volcanic eruptions

Plate tectonics affecting ocean currents

So yes— it is true that climate has naturally changed over time.

2. But the current warming is different.

What’s happening now isn’t following those slow, natural cycles that God originally created. The big differences are:

Speed: Past natural changes took thousands to millions of years. The warming since the Industrial Revolution (about 150 years) is happening extremely fast.

Cause: Scientists can measure the exact gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄) have risen sharply since humans started burning coal, oil, and gas. These gases trap heat—this is basic physics, not opinion.


3. How much is caused by humans?

The overwhelming scientific consensus is:

More than 100% of the warming since 1850 is human-caused. I know that sounds weird. How can it be more than 100%. But here’s why: natural factors (like solar cycles and volcanoes) would have led to a slight cooling in recent decades. The fact that we are warming instead means that human activity (burning fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial pollution) has more than outweighed those natural effects.


For example:

NASA, NOAA, the IPCC, and over 97% of climate scientists agree that the recent warming trend is driven mainly by humans.

Without human greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth would probably be slightly cooler right now.


4. Why do some textbooks downplay this?

Certain Christian or conservative curriculum providers (like BJU Press, A Beka, etc.) often frame climate change as mostly natural, partly because they want to align science with a particular worldview that emphasizes God’s control over creation and skepticism toward secular science. But the actual data collected by satellites, ice cores, tree rings, and direct measurements strongly shows the fingerprints of human activity.


So the short answer is:

Yes, Earth’s climate has changed naturally in the past.

But the rapid warming of the past 150 years is overwhelmingly caused by humans.

The best evidence shows that almost all of today’s warming is human-driven, NOT by the natural cycles designed or initiated by God.

The problem isn't with the global increase per se (even though this also causes stronger wind currents and extremer floods/rainfalls) for ecosystems, it is the extreme short period in which we warm the earth globally. 

Another pitfall/myth often used is that we humans only produce a small percentage of all greenhouse gases on earth. Once again, this is technically a fact, but they come to a wrong conclusion. The earth is in constant balance, we have our climate due to homeostasis in global greenhouse gas emissions.

It’s not unfounded to say that private religious schools would tend to lean into more conservative teachings. 

And it’s also not unfounded to say that conservatives teachings tend to disagree with human caused global warming. 

It’s “bad for business”. People want to see a booming economy and a shrinking government deficit. Forcing companies to comply with rules that could hamstring their productivity is unpopular. Especially when other countries are not doing the same. 

Here are the facts and you can make of them what you will:  the earth does heat and cool. There was an ice age and that ice age ended naturally. Glaciers receded. Some animal species went extinct. Primarily the megafauna. Those animal required the most resources to live and as the climate changed (slowly, but not so slowly that they had a chance to evolve and adapt) they died out. 

However. The climate changed in the last 300 years has happened so quickly that it cannot be attributed solely to the natural warming and cooling cycle of the earth. 

Does that mean it’s human caused? Well the scientists say yes. We are the only new variable. What else could cause this other than our thousands of factories and such pumping out unthinkable tons of greenhouse gases?

Throw in all the toxic things we’ve thrown in the water over that last 200 years and the coral starts dying.

comment,nh2cl6t,t3_1nt58pw,How much of global warming is actually caused by humans?,"Climate changes for a reason. 

Scientists have measured warming, this is a fact. A rise in temperatures beginning slowly ~150 years ago, and accelerating quickly now to about +1.5ºC.

So what has caused it?

The short answer is: the math and physics calculates that **the warming of +1.5ºC over the past 150 years is caused *entirely* by human emissions.** In fact, if we removed all our emissions, the world would be slightly cooler now than 150 years ago (like -0.1ºC). But since the temperature has actually increased, about 1.5ºC, we can say that human behaviour is about 110% the cause of global warming! (This also might have factored in land usage, but still, it's all human effects)

Much longer answer:

There are many factors that affect the temperature:

* The Sun
* orbital mechanics / Milankovitch cycles
* volcanoes
* aerosols
* greenhouse gases
* clouds
* albedo (reflectivity of the ground)

**The Sun:**

We just went through one of the coolest solar cycles in the past 100 years. But we continued breaking temperature records. So it's not the Sun. In times when the Sun was extremely inactive, the earth cooled about 0.5ºC. Which is nowhere near the 1.5ºC of warming we've seen. It's not the sun causing global warming.

**Orbital Mechanics:**

As the planet wobbles and changes its position in orbit around the Sun, the total amount of energy hitting the Earth (and where it hits the Earth) varies. This is a leading factor in ice ages starting and ending. But this works on timescales of thousands or 10s of thousands of years. What we are seeing today is working in decades. So it's not orbital mechanics.

**Volcanoes:**

Volcanoes can emit greenhouse gases. You may have heard the ""fact"" that a volcanic eruption outputs more CO2 in a day than humans do in a year, or some variation of this. It isn't true. On a yearly average basis, all the Earth's volcanoes combined only output about 1% as much greenhouse gases as humanity. And that amount is part of the natural balance that had kept CO2 at around 280ppm or the last 1+ million years until just this last century. So it's not volcanoes. In fact, when there is a big volcanic eruption, it puts lots of ash in the sky, which can cool the earth for months or more.

** Aerosols:**

Human pollution puts aerosols in the atmosphere, like SO2, sulphur dioxide. Forest fires and volcanoes as well. These particles block sunlight from reaching the ground, cooling the earth measurably. So it's not aerosols causing warming. They cause cooling.

**Greenhouse Gases (GHGs such as CO2 and CH4 (methane)):**

These are gases that allow light to pass through them easily, but reflect heat radiation. Light from the Sun passes through the atmosphere, hits the ground, turns to heat, and then with higher amounts of GHG in the atmosphere, the heat radiation takes longer to escape back out to space. It's a lot like using a thicker blanket when sleeping, you stay hot because the heat is trapped and takes longer to work its way through the blanket.

Nearly 200 years ago, scientists discovered this effect, and about 130 years ago the math was done to predict how much it would raise temperatures of the planet. This was basically science fiction at the time, because the idea that we could put out 35 gigatonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere per year was ridiculous at the time. Cars hadn't even been invented. The value calculated was about 4ºC per doubling of the concentration of CO2. These days, with more knowledge, the value appears to be closer to 3ºC (a value Exxon's scientists used in 1980 to predict the next 45 years incredibly accurately).

We have a situation where over 100 years ago, using science, physics, and math, an effect was predicted. Over time this was refined, and predictions from 50 years ago based on CO2 have been extremely accurate, including the one by Exxon (who were experts in predicting how much oil would be burned in the next 50 years, which, following the math, made their prediction of temperature very accurate).

**Other Factors:**

Water vapour is also a strong greenhouse gas, but it's part of the feedback loop of CO2 predictions. So you could say the increase due to the actual CO2 molecules is 0.5ºC and water caused 1.0ºC, but we knew the water would be a side effect of the CO2 so when we say temperatures increase 3ºC when CO2 doubles, that includes the corresponding increase of water vapour.

More water vapour means more clouds. This works both ways, because clouds reflect light, but they also trap heat. Anyone from the cold north knows that the coldest days of winter are the days there are no clouds.

**How Do We Know the CO2 is from Humans?:**

The carbon atoms from fossil fuels have a signature: they are completely non-radioactive, unlike CO2 from new, natural sources (like forest fires, decomposition...). We measure that the ratio of non-radioactive CO2 in the air is increasing, which means the increase of CO2 in the air is from fossil fuels.",smozoma,3,1759262120,30-09-2025 19:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nt58pw/how_much_of_global_warming_is_actually_caused_by/nh2cl6t/

Natural emissions are primarily from vegetation and land (439 gigatonnes per annum) and oceanic release (332 gigatonnes per annum). Absorption is roughly equal (450 gigatonnes per annum and 338, respectively). However, human activity releases an additional 29 tonnes per annum.

Although our output of 29 gigatons of CO2 is very small to the 750 gigatons moving through the carbon cycle each year, it adds up because the land and ocean cannot absorb all of the extra CO2. About 40% of this additional CO2 is absorbed. The rest remains in the atmosphere, and as a consequence, atmospheric CO2 is at its highest level in 15 to 20 million years (see Tripati et al 2009, http://www.sciencemag.org/content/326/5958/1394.abstract).

The earth is more than 6 billion years old as far as we know. It began as a large “rock” with more and more chunks of asteroids and “local” materials smashing into the big rock by gravitational forcing. This “coming together” caused frictional heating over a long long period of time. Eventually leading to what we would think of as a “volcanic planet.”

Then, over an even longer time, the volcanic planet eventually built up enough gas from thermal venting, mixed with ice particles and crystals that an atmosphere began to develop.  With an atmosphere came processes like gas exchanges and sublimation.  This created the building blocks for life to form and then become more complex.  Over many more millions and millions of years, the earth became cooler and cooler where oceans formed.  Now it was an oceanic planet with volcanoes.

Millions more years later as algae release oxygen into the atmosphere, even more complex life comes about like dinosaurs. Land masses grow vegetation where once was volcanic matter. And the expansion of vegetative and organic life eventually led to further cooling to the point that the planet was now “tropical” in climate.  

And then millions of years later, only within the last 1-5 million years from present day (Eocene period), the earth cooled so substantially that it entered what we call the “temperate” phase.  This is where we have complex fluid- pressure dynamics like the jet stream and rossby waves which send polar based upper level areas of pressure down (or up) towards the equatorial region.  This transporting (both in ocean and air) of heat from equatorial regions towards the poles and cool water and air from poles to the equator is how our world stays temperate and sustainable for the most complex of life.

Humans are now reversing this LINEAR terrestrial process by pumping CO2 and methane and nitrous oxide etc into the atmosphere.  The CO2 levels are already back to Eocene period levels.  We achieved that in no less than 200 years whereas the earth would have taken millions and millions to achieve the opposite as it did.  And 1 million years ago or so, the CO2 levels are where we have now put them back up towards these last few decades.  And the oceans back then were 200 feet higher and the planet was tropical.

So I hope you like the jungle and ocean and sweltering heat.  Because that’s where we are headed and ENTIRELY due to human (anthropogenic) causes and forcing.

As you can see, the amount fluctuates every few hundred thousand years, but humans have added many tons of CO2 into the atmosphere *very very quickly.* All of that CO2 absorbs heat and radiates it back to earth, causing the earth to warm up. A big part of the problem is the speed at which this is occurring. The Earth can only survive perhaps a generation or two of this type of dumping CO2 into the atmosphere before everything on Earth dies. I know that's dramatic and it won't happen for a couple hundred years, but probably by the time you are in your 80s entire cities will be under water. I'm so sorry to break this news to you.

comment,ngrgtl6,t3_1nt58pw,How much of global warming is actually caused by humans?,"It’s been known that CO2 is a greenhouse gas since 1857. This was discovered by scientist Eunice Newton Foote. This has been scientifically proven. The amount of CO2 and the average temperature in the world fluctuate as well.

The earth produces a lot of CO2 and it takes in about the same amount of CO2. This fluctuates a bit, depending on many different things like deforestation, amount of algea in the sea and time of the year (rotting leaves add CO2 while more photosynthesis takes in CO2). 

However, on top of that humans add 30 billion tonnes of CO2. And that is a problem. About half of that is taken in by plants, the rest builds up in our environment. So while it’s true that most of the CO2 in the earth system is not produced by humans, the problem lies in the extra amount that accumulates due to human activity. Human activities have raised the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide content by 50% in less than 200 years. 

If you want to read more about how we know that, I recommend reading this: https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/?_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9_iqe4kproUcAdB5RCZmxkRTc0S2cksSUwRcewM2iFyLtQ583trmsDw4TzKrH3NAB1T27W

It shows the amount of CO2 and the earth’s average temperature for the last 800,000 years. CO2 and temperature generally follow each other closely (they enhance each other: colder means more CO2 capture in ice, warmer means more rotting leaves). It shows how completely unprecedented this is.

And then you might think “what difference does a few degrees on average make?” It matters a lot. The difference between the last ice age when everything was glaciers and now is 6 degrees celcius (11 fahrenheit). The difference between the “little ice age” in Europe during the middle ages and the 1950’s is only 1,5 celcius. There were no more summers in Europe, only harsh winters and the rest of the year felt like autumn.

To say that past warming and cooling (ice ages) hundreds of millions of years ago was not caused by humans is correct.

Because humans had not evolved yet!

Depending on how far you go back there weren’t any mammals on this planet when a lot of the carbon was laid down.

So year that’s true (strictly speaking)

But that is just a bs argument 

What we know as a fact is that humans have been extracting that carbon in increasing amounts so that now we’re burning and blowing millions of tons of it up and into the atmosphere.

The effects of CO2 in the atm is very well known.

So it’s just simple math.

The reason why we hear all these lies is not just because of foolish people spreading them
It’s because hundreds of billions of dollars are generated by their use and that flows into the hands of extremely wealthy people (generationally wealthy)

It's obvious that global warming is happening. The question of whether or not it's human-caused is interesting because it has implications on how to mitigate it.

comment,ngsqc8b,t3_1nt58pw,How much of global warming is actually caused by humans?,"Climate deniers are very much like religious creationists. They love to jump on 'inconsistencies' to 'prove' science is wrong.

A creationist might say 'Science has been changing its mind on how old the earth is, therefore we are right and it was created last Tuesday' when in fact the scientific method has been used to colse in on a more accurate date.

or a creationist will jump on some new discovery (an older humanoid fossil) or an outlying scientist's statement and shout 'Science is wrong'. Ignoring the scientific consensus or that the scientific method will, over time, always direct us toward a more accurate description of the world.

I am old enough to remember when a theory was that the dinosaurs died out because evolving mammals ate their eggs, and continental drift was discussed but no mechanism was known. In the late 60's scientists were led to the Chicxulub impact crater and the US nuclear monitoring system led to the discovery of plate tectonics. Scientific understanding jumped forward because of this. Why do I know this? Because I have intellectual curiosity and so if someone tells me a snake talked because it says so in a book, I do research and see what science says about the ability of a snake to talk - or freshwater fish surviving a global flood.

With climate science new data has been obtained over the decades and new ideas have progressed the discussion. When I was growing up the talk was of an ice age, then it was global warming and now it is climate change. THEY ARE ALL THE SAME THING. The evidence from the ice cores (the sawtooth) shows that cyclicly the earth's temperature rises quickly and cools steadily (like a sawtooth) over a period of roughly 100k years.

The ice core data we now provides 8-9 well resolved cycles with further cycles less well resolved at this point. That's 8-9 cycles where we \[scientists\] can, through well tested procedures, analyze trapped gases and temperature proxies to determine the state of the atmosphere and the global historic temperature. The big takeaway from this is that the last glacial maximum (the top of the sawtooth) was 20k years ago, and all evidence from the ice cores is that we should be part way down the slope of the sawtooth. Instead the temperature is rising (global warming) ever faster because of the greenhouse effect (indisputable) of us altering the atmosphere by pumping CO2 into it. The temperature increase will accelerate as more ice melts (ice is a good reflector, less ice more heat gets absorbed). When atmospheric temperature changes, weather patterns change, sea levels and currents change, weather patterns change, growing zones change (imaging US grain belt shifting 500 miles north or south) all of these changes are Climate change. When the temperature peaks it will then drop inexorably down the other side of the sawtooth (Global Cooling).

In the USA politicians are bought and paid for. The Oil, Tyre and Motor industry have a history of paying politicians to promote anything that will increase their profits. The public are influenced by the culture that is promoted by these people. Some scientists can also be bought and they produce reports that are biased to spreadd the 'right' message.

The reason our small annual contribution makes such a difference is that it comes on top of the *relative* equilibrium in nature. Yes, it changes, but slowly. Nature removes approximately the same amount of CO2 that it produces every year. It isn’t exactly the same but the difference is on average much lower than the percentages we add to the atmosphere.

Nature cannot just get rid of this extra CO2 we release from burning fossil fuels. It goes into the atmosphere and it adds up. Over the 250 years of industrialisation our small annual contribution has led to double the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.

This kind of condescending way of interacting with people who are just trying to find guiding help is one of the reasons people turn away from listening to the facts and science.

------

As for your actual question. Yes, climate change is happening is we are extremely confident that it is human caused.

What your school is teaching is a half truth. It is a dishonest method of teaching things so that they aren't technically lying but they are not showing the full picture.

It IS true that the Earth had fluctuation in average temperature in the past. Sometimes waay hotter than now. [Here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk3705) you can find an article about the Earth's 485 million history of surface temperature. However, as you can see in the  [graph](https://www.science.org/cms/10.1126/science.adk3705/asset/8d762ca5-65f7-4691-9ef0-6ef25ea3f61f/assets/images/large/science.adk3705-fa.jpg), these change happened over MILLIONS of years.

Not only that, human history in itself is MINISCULE compared to the entirety of Earth's history. Humans have only existed for around 300.000 year AND of those 300.000 years we only began to form societies 10.000 years ago. This is why it is a lot more useful to study the temperature averages over human history. Because this what we are interested about, how can it affect us?.

This [article](https://leisureguy.ca/2013/04/01/recent-warming-is-still-unprecedented-in-speed-scale-and-cause-a-marcott-et-al-faq/) talks about a recent study. In it we can see a rather grueling [fact](https://leisureguy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/carbon-t-f.jpg).

As you can see, the blue line is the historical temperatures within modern human history and the red line is the projected temperature. Humans have never experienced temperatures so warm before. Not even close.

All of this to tell you the first point: 
1. The current temperature change is an anomaly, and something is seriously putting it the world out of balance.

--------


Now we need to answer the question, what is this something. Is it us? Is it something else? How can climate scientists be so sure that it is us?

The first thing is understanding HOW the earth is getting  warmer. The Earth normally heats up and cools down all the time due to solar cycles. These cycles are very well known, we call them ""day and night"" and ""spring summer fall winter"" or ""seasons"". 

We (we as in scientists) discovered that it is only surface temperatures changed while the upper atmosphere remained cool. This means that there is something in the air that is causing the earth to heat up and it is not the sun (otherwise even the upper atmosphere would also heat up). We have also found out that nights in average are getting hotter faster than days are getting hotter, similarly, winter is also getting hotter faster than summer for example.

All of this made us suspect that there is something in the air (atmosphere) that is retaining heat instead of letting it radiate off into space. This is why we called it the greenhouse effect. Much like greenhouses, there is something that is keeping the heat in Earth.

We looked around to find which gasses have changed in recent years and we found that the biggest change is the amount of Carbon Dioxide or CO2. Since the industrial revolution, this gas has increased like crazy. We are infact nearing 440ppm when it used to be around 280ppm throughout the entire human history.

The science behind it is a bit hard to get into in one post, but we have since discovered and confirmed that the main culprit of this greenhouse effect is Carbon Dioxide.

Not only that we have seen that the increase of this Carbom Dioxide correlates HEAVILY with the raise im temperatures.

So second point: 2. This something is CO2, which has exploded in quantity in our atmosphere in recent years, and has causes increases in temperature through the greenhouse effect.

-------

Well, next question then, how do we know that we are causing this CO2? Couldnt be a coincidence? How do we know it is us?

Analyzing the CO2 isotopes in the atmosphere we have found that most of the increased CO2 contains ancient carbon atoms that are rare isotopes only found in fossil fuels.

The timing also coincides with the start of the industrial revolution and the rate of increase follows our industrial output.

There is more proof, but these two alone already show third point: 3. Most of the CO2 comes from burning fossil fuel. Which has been increasing his tje Indistrial Revolution.",IceLovey,2,1759240444,30-09-2025 13:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nt58pw/how_much_of_global_warming_is_actually_caused_by/nh0a7yz/

But the reality is those two sides are not equal. The second side, the one that says it is natural and not an emergency, is made up entirely of fake science that can’t get published in peer reviewed journals because the purpose is not to do science the purpose is to sow doubt and protect profits. It is all self published by think tanks and PR firms. It looks like science to lay people, but it is all just propaganda.

In reality, among actual science that does stand up to peer review, the two sides are 1) It is definitely man made and definitely an emergency and we should have been doing something about this decades ago and things are about to get much worse and the whole world must act now.

Don't feel badly, your private school education is not an isolated example of intentional misinformation at the hands of our hydrocarbon industry.

Look here: [https://hechingerreport.org/coverage-of-climate-change-in-college-textbooks-is-headed-in-the-wrong-direction/](https://hechingerreport.org/coverage-of-climate-change-in-college-textbooks-is-headed-in-the-wrong-direction/)

Governments, whole industries, and even many professional engineers, even science fiction writers, have been fooled into supporting or pursuing ill advised, unecononmical, dangerous and unworkable projects like ""The Hydrogen Economy"", ""Carbon Capture and Storage"", and ""Clean Coal"".   These indefensible projects, and the public confusion about the cause of this human driven mass extinction event,  arise due to billions public relations dollars spent by the entrenched hydrocarbon industry.

The sad fact for me is that the cost of remediating the damage done to our planet will be at least 10's, but probably 100's of times the profits that was made while spewing these toxic gasses into the atmosphere.  

Still, too many of the poorly educated, and especially the mis-educated, have been convinced that the cost of doing something about it is too high, and are even fighting to maintain the status quo despite the fact that there are cheaper and better technologies already available for our energy infrastructure.  

Some are even willing to undermine established technologies and even put a stop to nearly completed renewable projects which unfortunately just barely begin to address the issue of our atmospheric cabon pollution.   A few folks go so far as expressing the intention to go back to the terrible pollluting technologies of the past.

I see even bigger changes to our climage in the near future as there are other positive feedback effects taking hold that were bought on by our irresponsible massive release of these planet warming gasses.   I'm afraid that we have surpassed a tipping point and that a runaway greenhouse gas future is in store for the planet.   The melting of permafrost is releasing methane and CO2, much faster that we can do it with our coal fired power plants, and I am also concerned about methane hydrates that are become increasingly unstable sitting on continental shelfs on the ocean floor. 

It's a bleak future that I paint here, but from from everything I see it is realistic and probably unavoidable. That doesn't mean that we should do nothing about it, but we have not even stopped digging the hole that is already too deep to climb out of, so I have little hope of a good future for our progeny.

Personally, I also spend some of my formative years at a private Christian school, and I know that there was other misinformation disseminated at that school.  

Some would say that I was indoctrinated, but fortunately the dogma was just too hard to swallow and it failed to take for me.   Oh yes, I might be happier had I remained ignorant of the realities of life, the universe, and everything, but even though some say that ""ignorance is bliss"" I am satisfied that I know a truth much deeper that of my poor heaven bound peers.",gododium,2,1759351050,01-10-2025 20:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nt58pw/how_much_of_global_warming_is_actually_caused_by/nh91fpc/

Basically, the earth goes through long periods of heating and cooling, but because of human activity (largely, burning fossil fuels for energy) this is happening at a faster rate than normal. 

Typically, this much of a change in the earth, like rise of atmospheric CO2, for example, in such a short amount of time is too fast for ecosystems to adapt. We’ve seen that already today in what some scientists are calling the “sixth mass extinction” in earths history.

It’s all very sad, but we can limit the damage through action. A lot of people want to deny climate change exists because it is tragic to admit we are the ones causing it.

The pace of change has very rarely been anywhere near this rapid in times for which good climate proxies are available (10s of millions of years at least).  Moreover human judgement of climate impact is strongly biased by the impact on our species.  We have coastal centered settlement patterns and food systems built around expectations of rainfall and irrigation water, and temperature s within given ranges.  This makes us vulnerable to sea level rise, and changing precipitation and temperature patterns.  Not to mention that we don't easily tolerate temperatures near or above our body temperature.

Vast areas of forest have been converted to savannah and even desert in drying periods in the past.  But this happened over millions of years, not over the course of a century, and humans hadn't yet evolved, much less built vast, complex economies and settlements.

Also, earth's heating and cooling has always been coincident with increase in global CO2, and over the past 150 years we have put in an unprecedented amount of CO2 into atmosphere (the earth has NEVER had so much CO2 ever, except maybe the very early phase of earth's formation or some other very very uninhabitable times).

comment,ngruh7v,t3_1nt58pw,How much of global warming is actually caused by humans?,"For the people who are trying to claim that man made things are not causing climate change, I have occasionally been able to get them to consider something beyond the indoctrination with a simple exercise.
“Does concrete absorb and reflect heat from the sun differently than grass, trees, or dirt?”
(Of course it does. Anyone who has felt a concrete sidewalk in the summer can understand that it is significantly warmer than the plants near it.)
“Concrete is used worldwide for building structures. There are more concrete structures now than ever before in the history of the world. How could replacing plants with concrete not have an effect, especially when it covers so much of the world today?”

It isn’t deep, but it focuses on something that almost everyone can directly experience if they live in a city. 

The argument about climate change SHOULD be “is it something we want our government to care about” not “is it real”. It should not be a political debate about if there are more people, buildings, vehicles, and machines than there were 500 years ago. That should be an obvious and acceptable fact to everyone. Once you recognize that fact, it’s a small logical step to realize that the roads, buildings, and parking lots retain and shed both heat and water differently than plants and dirt. 

Different = change

Almost everything we do as humans has both good and bad consequences. Most of us try to make choices that end up helping the world more than hurting, but sometimes we have some pretty slim justifications.

If you want to stress your teachers out, ask them why this curriculum would want to present this idea from such a one-sided perspective that ignores so much real data. Who profits from this perspective? 

The Christian faith calls us to be stewards of the earth, and it is seems like work that goes against God’s natural order must be guided by the Prince of Lies, right? In no world would God be happy about strip mining operations and the desecration of the mountains and all life that had lived there.

Volcanic eruptions, asteroid impacts, and Milankovitch cycles drive these heating and cooling cycles. Humans are responsible for chemical changes in the atmosphere which are one of the ways the earth may heat or cooling. Human changes to the atmosphere, by itself is not all the significant but perhaps the RATE of change is. In other words the earth has for most of its existence with life on it had co2 concentrations way above 400ppm. But the RATE at which humans accelerated atmospheric co2 is significant and a factor in warming or cooling trends. 

So to answer your question - humans are unequivocally changing the climate of Earth. How could we not be? And some of this change may be occuring faster than it would otherwise have naturally.

The Earth has also had atmospheres with much higher levels of CO² than it has today 

As many people have said, it's the speed of change that is causing the issues we have now, the Earth hasn't warmed so quickly in the past, changes in temp of this scale normally take 100,000 + years (PETM) rather than a couple of 100 years. As for the historical higher levels of CO² that was millions of years before any humans existed, let alone the 8 billion we currently have, all of whom rely on the climate for food and existence.

Yes, the planet undergoes long-term (think tens of thousands, not hundreds, of years) natural cooling and heating cycles — Milankovitch cycles, which are determined by the planet's distance, degree of tilt, and orientation toward the sun. Interestingly, for most of geological history, Earth was much warmer than it is today. Earth didn't have ice caps when the dinosaurs existed, for instance, for complex reasons related to volcanism and the arrangement of the continents.

But, according to the ""cycles"" in question, the Earth \*should\* currently be cooling.

comment,ngxywso,t3_1nt58pw,How much of global warming is actually caused by humans?,"Sigh. 

There are whole websites devoted to the data and models that underpin the man made global warming position.

When the deniers say it is natural, the earth has undergone periods of hearing and cooling, that is true. What the deniers won't tell you is that the mechanisms that caused warming and cooling are the exact same mechanisms that are in the climate models that predict warming, with man as the proximate cause. 

If a denier trots out the it's natural argument, they are unwittingly voicing support for the models that predict warming. You cannot have it both ways. Either the mechanisms that drive warming work, or they don't. 

Last, the greenhouse effect is not an academic discussion point. Until Mann published his seminal observations, the greenhouse effect was universally accepted. Without the greenhouse effect the earth would not be habitable. This was taught in high school science classrooms nationwide. 

The politicization of scientific findings is a self defeating proposition in the long run. If the science is wrong, it will be corrected. That is the way science works. There is nothing a scientist craves more than upsetting the status quo. Why? It means the scientist has made a significant discovery. It is how we build our reputations. There are no playoffs, no rave reviews, no millions of followers. But, in your field, other investigators know who made truly novel, influential discoveries. 

Last, conservatives have almost always  been on the wrong side of the science. Tobacco/cancer, acid rain, fishery management, ozone/CFCs, lead on gasoline, etc. Generally, the negative effects of technology are associated with profits. Controlling and/or mitigating these negative effects are costly, or unpopular. Companies contribute to conservatives because they will take the money and protect the industries that pollute/overuse of resources. 

It is often difficult to know who or what to believe when one is faced with conflicting claims. I have guidelines for sourcing information.

1. Review all industry sponsored sources with scepticism. These sources are often incomplete. They report information that supports the industry and leave out results that run counter to their narrative. 

2. Look towards the peer reviewed scientific literature. The jargon and methods are daunting. Start with reviews. They are less technical and more approachable. 

3. Never buy into anything that makes claims without proof. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. A glitzy claim is enticing, especially when it promises good things with minimal costs, should be approached with extreme caution. 

4. Use common sense, with a good imagination. Just because you can't ""see"" the observation being true, does not mean it is wrong. Use your imagination, look at the issue from all perspectives before drawing a conclusion.

5. Change your mind. Science accumulates, results are confirmed, or disproved. As the science changes, so should your opinion. It is acceptable to be sceptical early. If the initial observations are confirmed and extended, take that into consideration. At some point, a contrarian position becomes untenable.  Don't be the last to adopt the findings. It makes you look ignorant.

6. Science is not democratic. Just because all your friends dump on a concept does not invalidate the concept. The science does not care. It will work perfectly in the face of your disbelief. 

7. Never buy anything when there is a chandelier around. The window dressing is designed to fool and confuse you. Untrustworthy types  so use meta to fool you into buying in. Be cognizant if such plots. 

8. Track records matter. Fools tend to remain foolish. People who are consistently wrong are likely to be wrong again. They are wrong because their thought processes are warped and dysfunctional. The may be right, just don't rely on them for your conclusions.

9. Are the alternatives strong? An observation with alternative interpretations are common. If alternatives are strong, then scepticism is called for.

10. Take out emotion. Controversial topics stir emotions. Forget them. Go Spock when reviewing new information. Studies have shown that people who lose objectivity are suceptible to misinformation.

Taking in new information and determining its value is not easy. It requires time. And knowledge. It was easy in the Google days to be a 1 hour expert. AI has made it trivial to become a 5 min expert. True experts rely on years of education and experience. And they still get it wrong at times. A visit to two websites does not make your opinion as valid as a professor in the field. That is the way it is.",mdcbldr,1,1759200511,30-09-2025 02:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nt58pw/how_much_of_global_warming_is_actually_caused_by/ngxywso/

comment,nh09f44,t3_1nt58pw,How much of global warming is actually caused by humans?,"Climate change is a study of the deviation of climate from the naturally occurring cycles. We can measure how those external influences on climate happen and the cycles they take. Some over years, some over decades, some over centuries, and some over millennia. Climate change is about the when it goes outside of those natural patterns.

99.8% of the scientific community that studies climate is in agreement that man is responsible for the vast majority of these changes. We measure everything we can, and the results show us that almost all of the change is coming from man made sources. We can match the changes to the things we are doing, and they match perfectly. The people claiming otherwise have yet to be able to do so.

For them to claim that the causes are all natural is no different than claiming the Earth is flat. It requires the same amount of dishonesty. Yes the earth has been cooling and heating. But that's climate, not climate change. Climate change is about what is changing those cycles from what they have done historically. And those differences match what humans have been doing such as increasing CO2 output, etc.

Normally, global average temperatures rise and fall gradually according to patterns that are discernible geologically over the very long term.

Right now, global average temperatures, and human-caused global carbon dioxide emissions, are simultaneously jumping in an unprecedented spike that is discernible not in geological time but in real time, year by year.

What we do know is that the earth was created millions of years ago. It is dynamic and not static, with enormous forces of matter in a constant state of change. Those forces, and other external forces in our universe, change and evolve the earth and our environment over time. This will continue in the future long beyond the passing of every person alive on the planet. Man’s activities have minuscule impact compared to these vast forces. It’s a testament to the egos of men that they think they do. We need to do what intelligent people have done through the ages to live and prosper.

We need to realize the need to minimize our impact.

The planet is going to survive. The question is whether or not we will, or what we will become. More importantly, the collateral damage to the ecosystem that was just chilling, until we rolled up here.

If we don’t address it, we will be a thin layer of sediment in the crust and nothing else. Good job, humanity!

We won’t be either the joke or the punchline. The most we will leave behind is just a line where future geologists, who aren’t human, will say in their equivalence of a TED talk,

comment,nh9i930,t1_ngr5in5,How much of global warming is actually caused by humans?,"We should quantify this a bit (disclaimer, I am not an expert). Basically we release roughly 5% of global carbon emission per year (measured in giga-tons of CO2). The one thing to realize is that it's a dynamical system (the carbon cycle) and that the human contribution kicks the system out of equilibrium. Due to humans, the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere has increased from ~280ppm circa 1750 to ~425ppm today. The fit is exponential, with emissions yielding a ~2.4ppm increase per year over the last decade.
  
The extra concentration of CO2 leads to a greenhouse effect on our atmosphere (like the inside of a car on a hot sunny day, the CO2 being analogous to the glass). Basically, the CO2 lets in light but then blocks infrared (heat) from radiating outward. The +145ppm delta captures a MASSIVE amount of heat per year, roughly 50x that of the current *global* energy usage. If you include all greenhouse gases, it's roughly 90x.
  
Considering all greenhouse gases (methane being the next most prominent) we can compute projections for temperature rises. The current total temperature rise is ~1.2C. Continuing the exponential trend yields ~3.9C rise by the year 2100. If we hold the current rate flat, we get a 3.2C rise by 2100.  
  
One should then quantify the economic cost and the personal suffering that this rise will incur. One should also consider the breakdown of global carbon emissions (from cars, cement, etc), and how long it takes for green-energy options to make up their production cost. I forget the details but I think wind turbines make up their carbon cost in ~1yr, and solar panels in 2-3 years. Then we can talk policy and the effort/spending that humanity should expend per year.

comment,nhhho9f,t1_ngr6an3,How much of global warming is actually caused by humans?,"Using ""the science"" mistakes what science is. ""the Science"" is about control of the political narrative. Same goes with scientific consensus. The very nature of the scientific process is about questioning everything and exploration.  And is antithetical to a consensus as it would suggest and end to questioning.  Only hypotheses that are well tested with continuous observance can reach close to some truth.

Now, don't mistake that to be anti-climate change. There is enough to suggest the climate is warming.  The nuances are quite deep because this field of study attempt to combine most of natural science fields into one.  Hence broad strokes are natural going to be wildly inaccurate. As have a lot of the early predictions have been.

But be careful because IPCC is a political body, and drawdown  gets and uses funding projects on the back of the political emergency global warming.  Essentially their money comes this axiom, if they had evidence to reject it, they would lose all funding and purpose.

  
Best thing to do is get involved and create and test your own hypotheses. Find out yourself is the best way to challenge your understanding.

In other words, monotheists don’t care because they think they’ll go to heaven and if the world gets really bad, god will end it anyway.

What’s caused by humans is the acceleration of it. There have been times in the earth’s history where CO2 concentrations were higher than today’s and higher than the projected peaks we are due to experience in this century. But the speed at which we have achieved them is unprecedented. Usually it would take tens to hundreds of thousands of years for CO2 to accumulate to these concentrations.

comment,nhnvok2,t1_nhncn3j,How much of global warming is actually caused by humans?,"Here are the basics of the science:



* CO2 in the atmosphere absorbs IR

* The earth's surface emits IR

* We are currently increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by 6% per decade

* We know the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere is from ancient carbon that we burn by looking at the isotopes of carbon

* We have increased the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by 50% in the last 150 years

* Current rate of temperature increase over the last 30 years is 2.4 C per century, far faster than natural increase

* Global mean surface temperature is 1.5C warmer than it was 150 years ago

* Over the last 2.5 million years temperatures have not been higher than today

* Atmospheric CO2 is now higher than the last 15 million years.

Sep 2025 : Direct attribution climate damages per company: 
'Here we show that climate change made 213 historical heatwaves reported over 2000–2023 more likely and more intense, to which each of the 180 carbon majors (fossil fuel and cement producers) substantially contributed. This work relies on the expansion of a well-established event-based framework1. Owing to global warming since 1850–1900, the median of the heatwaves during 2000–2009 became about 20 times more likely, and about 200 times more likely during 2010–2019. Overall, one-quarter of these events were virtually impossible without climate change. The emissions of the carbon majors contribute to half the increase in heatwave intensity since 1850–1900. Depending on the carbon major, their individual contribution is high enough to enable the occurrence of 16–53 heatwaves that would have been virtually impossible in a preindustrial climate. We, therefore, establish that the influence of climate change on heatwaves has increased, and that all carbon majors, even the smaller ones, contributed substantially to the occurrence of heatwaves. Our results contribute to filling the evidentiary gap to establish accountability of historical climate extremes7,8.'

It shows the earths temperature compared to the modern average, starting at 2000 BC. As you scroll down (=forward in time) you can see the temperature gradually rise and fluctuate. This is the natural process that you've been told about. 

Then at the end you can see a sudden bump. You can see how it's much more sudden compared to all other changes that came beforehand. That's the part that we are causing.

Let me know if you have any additional questions!

PS another common talking point is ""oh  a few degrees (Celsius) more, what's the big deal""

Sure, it doesn't sound like much. But it's the change in the average global temperature and it's enough to have extreme weather effects.

For comparison: on the graph you can see a miniscule dent labeled ""little ice age"". It's just a tiny shift in temperature yet it has disastrous consequences for humans at the time. Googling the phrase ""little ice age"" will give you details. And that was just a tiny shift. Now compare that to the change currently happening.

In an nutshell, the observed warming in the post industrial period is caused almost 100% by humans.

There is no increased output from the Sun in any solar cycle and the long slow changes in orbital dynamics (Milankovitch cycles) resulted in an optimum warmth (in a few latitudes) about 6000 BCE or so.  Scientists have looked heavily at \*every\* possibility. The results come up the same.

So without human greenhouse gas emissions (digging up fossil fuels and burning them, which have been non participants in climate for millions of years until now) there would be slow cooling.

comment,ngs4cd2,t1_ngrowt9,How much of global warming is actually caused by humans?,"The science was anything but clear in the 70s. Climate science as a whole was in its infancy in the 70s, so of course there would be some poor predictions when the body of knowledge was so small. But despite that, it was never the scientific consensus that there was an imminent ice age. There was concern from some scientists about aerosols and pollutants having a cooling effect on the climate, and some news headlines covering this concern gained a lot of attention, but all [throughout the 70s there was far more literature published](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_cooling#/media/File:PeerReviewedPapersComparingGlobalWarmingAndCoolingIn1970s.jpg) on the concern of greenhouse gasses leading to global warming, not cooling. But climate deniers always bring up the prediction of global cooling as a straw-man to dismiss all other predictions, despite scientists having 50 years more data and research today than we did in the 70s.

And the fact that you think this is all done in the name of a corrupt cash grab by scientists shows how little you know about climate researchers or the process of securing research grants at all (what a surprise). Scientists are far from being members of the top 1%, and their research funding does nothing to change that. Most of their grant money goes to actually funding the research, not into their pockets. It’s not the sort of career one gets into if they’re after a fat pay check. People get into research because they are passionate about that field and want to do their part to develop our understanding of the world and help come up with solutions to its problems.

One industry that does take in an extraordinary amount of money is of course the fossil fuel industry. It’s one of the most profitable industries on earth and has been for as long as it’s existed. And, ironically, their scientists were among the [first to discover the link between our CO2 emissions and global warming as far back as 1958](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/30/fossil-fuel-industry-air-pollution-fund-research-caltech-climate-change-denial), because those big oil executives wanted to know anything and everything that might put their profits at risk, like the fact that their product may lead to the collapse of the global economy, or at the very least to significant restrictions on their industry. So what were these poor oil barons to do? Cover up their research and fund disinformation campaigns for the next 70 years of course!

comment,ngvqger,t1_ngs5dst,How much of global warming is actually caused by humans?,"Even better, you can see what happens when humanity takes a step back. Look up pre-pandemic photos of air quality in major cities, along with eco-restoration appreciated in some bodies of water while we were locked indoors. There’s lots to look at, from NASA satellite photos, charts, graphs, to simple pictures taken by everyday people when they got to go outside. You can very clearly see the effects we have on nature, and it’s hard to argue it’s a net positive. 

Now, imagine all of this on a planetary scale. Over 100% of global warming since 1900 is human-driven. As recently as 2020, humans were dumping 9.5 BILLION metric tons of carbon into the air while decimating forests that could help us with the problem. We can’t blame 🌋 ‘s or solar conditions or really anything else, that’s on us. 

Humans have been seeing an upcoming car accident on the road ahead, but instead of tapping the breaks we’ve decided to hit the gas getting us that much closer to disaster. And yet, we keep wanting to blame everything from the car to road conditions, the car, to our neighbors for driving poorly when the answer was clearly to pump the breaks when something really bad is ahead. Even if you’re not sure, tap the breaks. 

On top of that, you have a generation that only cares about enriching themselves, knowing full well that they’ll be gone before they have to face the consequences. They’ll believe in a flat earth where all that extra carbon is just sliding off the edge before they admit to any problems.",RareSeaworthiness870,1,1759174103,29-09-2025 19:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nt58pw/how_much_of_global_warming_is_actually_caused_by/ngvqger/

comment,ngt28va,t1_ngrju72,How much of global warming is actually caused by humans?,"Oh man, there are Christians out here who agree with old round Earth, heliocentrism, evolution, Big Bang as best as we understand it, multiverse potential, other life in the universe, etc. Your faith doesn't mean you have to discount all scientific progress. Most Christians I've met (thousands) are scientifically minded and basically think things are so well organized that there was intelligent design at work. Personally I disagree on both counts, but it's okay! You don't have to throw your faith out being curious about science, but you might decide to explore other kinds of Christian beliefs. 


It's funny your school teaches an extreme, black and white view on religion/science because inevitably that causes many people to throw it all away, in the all or nothing spirit they're used to. But maturity warrants nuanced examination. I don't want you, or any young person, to automatically agree with me (a secular atheist), I want you to be informed to decide for yourself, and to choose healthy modes of belief which is possible within religion. But if you don't believe anymore, it's okay also, just will be tough until you gain independence. ",keegums,4,1759143346,29-09-2025 10:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nt58pw/how_much_of_global_warming_is_actually_caused_by/ngt28va/

But if jumping straight into reading scientific papers is a bit daunting and you’re still coming to terms about where your beliefs lie there is a YouTube channel called Genetically Modified Skeptic run by a guy who went through the same transition away from young earth creationism and embraced learning about science, history, psychology, and other religions. He has excellent videos explaining his own journey and his perspective on creationism and science, and I found that he was able to perfectly explain what I had been thinking but wasn’t able to put into words. Whatever your beliefs are just know that there’s nothing wrong with questioning them and searching for answers that might be disagree with you, and know that you’re definitely not alone in that.

Also, I’d reiterate everything that everyone has said here and add that the planet has its own global ecosystem, made up of all the little ecosystems…it’s not just that we humans have compressed this heating/cooling timeline by adding pollutants to the atmosphere in greater quantities and in a shorter time frame than it would have ever happened naturally…it’s that there is a delicate balance between all of these ecosystems that even small changes to the environment can make unstable. We don’t know which domino will cause the ecosystems to start to collapse, but we know that there is a tipping point that we do not want to hit. The oceans are becoming more acidic…this is an effect of climate change happening in this compressed time frame…and as a result of the massive amounts of chemicals and pollutants being dumped into the oceans…when you start to put these things together, because this is not a theoretical exercise…this is happening in the real world right now and we are seeing what happens when bad things multiply…just take a single industry…we have enough clothing on the planet to clothe the next several generations, but we keep making more, and then just throwing them onto landfills in the global south. Google it for some of the most disturbing images you could want to see. Not only is it a waste of production - it takes over 10,000 gallons of water to make a single pair of jeans - not to mention human labor  and general misery - and then the shipping and supply chains that use gasoline etc to deliver these boxes of unused clothing to global south landfills. The dyes are toxic, as are the synthetic fibers…and all of those chemicals leach back into the oceans, affecting the local flora and fauna …and that doesn’t just affect that one ecosystem, there are adjacent ecosystems that rely on the plants and animals for their lives….etc etc etc…this crisis does not exist just in the atmosphere, or up above in the ionosphere… although there are drastically negative effects happening there that are a crisis in and of themselves…it’s how everything on this planet is linked to everything else. The right (wrong) domino falls, the right (wrong) species goes extinct and we will start to see catastrophic changes at the basic biological levels affecting all life…all for 100 companies to continue making outrageous profits selling humanity fuzzy dice and SHEIN overalls….this is not and should not be politicized.

comment,ngt9ji2,t1_ngrnzaz,How much of global warming is actually caused by humans?,"So the climate changes. No way about it. There’s many factors that contribute to this; distance from the sun, earth’s wobble, atmospheric make up, the carbon cycle. That’s not an exhaustive list but gives you a basic idea. Those factors change, the climate changes. The earth isn’t a static environment, it has changed and will continue to change whether people are involved or not. 

Whats human caused climate change is impacting the carbon cycle. I don’t remember the numbers off the top of my head but humans contribute less than 10% of the total carbon emitted into the atmosphere per year. But this cycle is an equilibrium. Essentially this added carbon isn’t able to be sequestered or processed through the cycle and instead is now in the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect. And the system as a whole isn’t able to change rapidly enough in a few decades. There’s other emissions/elements that act similarly but carbon is the main one that’s talked about. 

It’s really not complicated, we are impacting a major component of an equilibrium. That’s going to have an effect on the whole system. To what degree you may ask? Well, now we don’t know and the science isn’t settled. Scientists can approximate and build models but in building these models some big assumptions have to be made. But the most accurate range I’ve seen is having twice the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere as there was pre Industrial Revolution would result in 1-5 degree Celsius increase in earths temperature. So there lies the challenge. Is it 1? Is it 5? If we raise the temp 1 or 2 degrees are we going to start affecting other parts of the system and *more* carbon will be emitted each year? Nobody has these answers but it really doesn’t seem good the more you learn.

And what a lot of people won’t mention, because they believe it helps their cause I imagine, is there is a bit of propaganda around climate change. There are alarmists and people who will say that reaching a certain part per million of CO2 will be a “point of no return” with apocalyptic predictions for only a couple years in the future. Usually they’re selling products or working for some type of think tank group. This really undermines the whole conversation as it’s bringing in an opinion. 

So I think we’re at a good stopping point here as we can get to talking about solutions if we continue.

This young person deserves to be empowered for the fact that he utilizes his ability to think independently and fact-checks what he is taught rather than just taking someone's word for it. I have more respect for this young man than I do most adults for doing what so many of them don't.

Also, I actually work in the psych field in behavioral psychology. Your analysis is way off, and I presume that I am definitely more qualified to make such as analysis because not one of my colleagues would have interpreted the exchange that way, and I wouldn't have, either. 

I don't believe in controlling other people and according to data, collaboration is a more positive way to solve problems than hierarchical relationships. In my field, we always say, ""Our aim is not to control, but to serve and support.""

What you just attempted to do was drive a wedge into an overall pleasant exchange and morph it into something it isn't. I am going to infer that it is because you disagree with those in this thread and felt personally attacked by it, so you lashed out in a wholly off-topic way and tried to hurt a young person's feelings in the process. That is so toxic. I'll look for your uninformed arguments that contain 0 evidence that disproves climate change further down the comments.

You saw a young person who questioned what he was being taught. You disagreed with everyone in the conversation, but you entered into it too late to control the narrative.

So, what did you do? You went immediately to the person who said explicitly that he is in school and he is not sure that he is being taught the truth because *that* is where you detected something you perceived as a weakness and targeted it to exploit.

I assume the H2S dissolved in anoxic seas could be released similar to a limnic eruption.   The one large modern-day anoxic sea full of H2S from 200 meters on down is the Black Sea.

post,1nsi7p0,,Climate change won’t be solved unless we hold supply chains accountable.,"A common refrain in climate debates is that there is little value in reducing national emissions while China continues to pollute at scale.

This perspective neglects a crucial fact: Western economies intentionally shifted large portions of their industrial base to China in pursuit of lower costs and higher shareholder returns. As a result, Western demand was instrumental in creating industrialised China. Criticising China’s emissions without acknowledging this history is therefore disingenuous.

If climate change is to be addressed effectively, responsibility must extend beyond national borders. Supply chains should be accredited and audited to ensure their environmental impact is transparent and accountable.

Politicians undermine themselves by pushing domestic carbon taxes while ignoring foreign supply chains. True leadership would explain that accrediting imports for their environmental footprint, furthermore explain that any additional costs at the border— would in fact drive global accountability and strengthens domestic industry.

However, Western nations do control what enters their markets—and that’s a powerful lever. The point isn’t to “blame buyers for manufacturers’ decisions,” it’s to acknowledge that demand shapes supply. If markets like the EU, US, or UK require environmental transparency as a condition of entry, suppliers—including China—have an economic incentive to comply.


And if China refuses transparency? Then yes, restrictions or tariffs are a natural outcome. That may sound extreme, but international trade has always worked this way—countries impose standards for safety, labour rights, or intellectual property. Environmental standards are no different.


On the cost issue: you’re right that tariffs and border adjustments raise prices, and consumers often react negatively. But the key is framing. When additional costs are explained not as arbitrary protectionism, but as a mechanism to hold global polluters accountable and strengthen domestic industry, they become an investment in resilience. 


The alternative is to continue importing cheap goods produced with little regard for emissions or pollution, which simply undermines domestic industries that try to play by the rules.

post,1nrt60z,,"Weekly roundup: upwelling shifts, Swiss glacier loss, UN risk update, Arctic sea ice","I’ve been writing a weekly roundup focused on how climate change is reshaping the ocean and the systems tied to it. This week’s edition covers four developments:

**1) Upwelling shifts**

New research flags changes in coastal upwelling that support fisheries. When upwelling weakens or shifts timing, nutrients drop, species move, and small-scale fishers lose reliable seasons. I walk through what the data shows and why timing matters for food webs.

**2) Swiss glaciers hit new lows**

Switzerland’s glaciers lost more ice again this year, with knock-on effects for European rivers that carry water, sediment, and nutrients to the seas. I summarize the latest monitoring and what it implies for summer flows and hydropower stability.

**3) UN climate impact update**

A new UN assessment outlines rising risks to coasts and fisheries, highlighting exposure in low-lying regions. I pulled out the sections on marine heat, acidification, and food security, and what adaptation actually looks like on the ground.

**4) Arctic sea ice continues to decline**

This season’s extent remains far below the long-term average. Beyond the headline number, I cover what thinner, younger ice means for Arctic ecosystems and weather patterns farther south.

post,1nrqg7d,,The emergency brake for the climate,"As you probably know, CO2 is the main greenhouse gas, but there are others, methane most significant among them. We don't emit nearly as much methane as CO2, but methane is much more potent, so about a third of current global warming is due to methane.

Most significant for our purposes, methane does not last as long in the atmosphere as CO2. Whereas CO2 remains for centuries, methane breaks down after about a decade. This means that if we  significantly cut methane emissions, we will dramatically slow the rate of warming almost immediately. Doing so would buy more time to decarbonize the global economy and otherwise get our shit together.

Imagine taking the current 2050 net zero target and moving it to 2080. Sounds a lot more plausible, doesn't it?

It gets even better. Unlike CO2, methane is not a direct bi-product of any important economic activity.  It comes from leaky pipes and other fossil fuel infrastructure, organic waste in landfills, ruminant animal agriculture, and rice paddies. (It also comes naturally from wetlands, but we don't want to disturb those ecosystems for obvious reasons.)

There are relatively low cost solutions for all major sources of methane emissions. Some of them won't get us to zero methane, but we don't need to get to zero. We need to get to ""much less."" The challenge is really a matter of raising awareness and building the political will to regulate better practices and technology adoption.

As the wells proliferate, so do concerns about the way many of the kilometres-deep holes in the ground are leaking because of cracked, poorly formed and decaying plugs and seals.

Industry says the plumbing problems can be managed, but questions mount over the way the wells are compromising not only the landscape but the water and resources below.

I don't think there's any practical reason we need to focus on methane, we have a number of very easy targets for intervention around CO2 (eg. Replacing the few hyperpolluting coal plants) that don't place the burden of behaviour change on billions of individuals. Plus, seeing as the largest contributor to methane emissions is fossil fuel extraction itself, it's a double, permanent win.

As Paul Hawken pointed out in his 2021 global best selling book:

>“Most people do not know what to do, or may believe the things they can do are insufficient. …

>“Most people in the world remain disengaged, and we need a way forward that engages the majority of humanity. Regeneration is an inclusive and effective strategy…”

>“Regeneration is not only about bringing the world back to life; it is about bringing each one of us back to life. It has meaning and scope; it expresses faith and kindness; it involves imagination and creativity. It is inclusive, engaging, and generous.""

>\[Regeneration\] “…restores forests, lands, farms and oceans. It transforms cities, builds green affordable housing, reverses soil erosion, rejuvenates degraded lands, and powers rural communities.”

>“Planetary regeneration creates livelihoods – occupations that bring life to people and people to life, work that links us to one-anothers’ well-being. It offers paths out of poverty that provide people with meaning, worthy involvement with their community, al living wage, and a future of dignity and respect.”

comment,ng5xs33,t3_1nqd2ix,is it really as bad?,"I would do a little research before asking a question like this. 

Let’s take a few scenarios and play with it. 

Climate change will cause sea levels to rise, that will cause millions upon millions of people to relocate from all over the planet. The shock of that change alone can make populations extremely hard to govern and can dramatically alter the resources available to a vulnerable population. 

Another scenario. 

As heat goes up and humidity does as well, there are millions of people who live near the equator who will die if they don’t move. Even more migration and even less resources as people will not be able to commit to economic activity in their countries as they face collapse. Couple that with higher efficacy of disease as a result of hotter and more humid conditions and it’s likely the millions will die. 

The politcial implications of just the two issues I laid out are enough to cause massive change and death. We as a planet are already anti-migrant. There will be wars fought over this and we will see millions die. 

It’s not nearly as simply as introducing plants or animals to environments. 

We haven’t touched the topic of ocean acidity, ocean temperature, extreme weather, insect activity, extinction events, ecological collapse, etc etc. 

Climate change is actually worse than what people generally think of it because it’s a chaotic event. We have no way of tracking every variable and therefore there are issues we haven’t measured yet.

When people have to make the decision to live or die, they will do violent things. 

As resources become more scarce due to swift global change you will see people appeal to authoritarianism in order to deal with the mass change and that too will cause mass death. 

Insect life and disease will also react to more humid and hot conditions and will make agricultural activity much more difficult coupled with global disorder and we have a possible collapse of governments. Maybe not the largest governments but even then. Antibiotics will have reduced efficacy and availability as well. 

The economic shock alone will make it extremely hard to govern any population without threat of revolution. And revolution will create even more scarcity and chaos in a time where we need stability and reaction. 

At the end of the day millions of people will die, and we should be taking action right now to mitigate the worst problems climate change will bring. But instead we are doing the opposite, at least in the US. 

As ecological pillars also collapse, like as the ocean becomes warmer and more acidic, biodiversity will die and again agriculture will be further affected. Food will become less nutritious, and our planet will literally become more toxic to live in. 

Sure some people will live and adapt accordingly. It’s just mostly going to be the most wealthy. Everyone else is going to suffer in one way or another and global quality of life will decrease to an insane degree.

•We conducted an evidence synthesis to map examples where assisted migration has been implemented around the world.
•Cases of assisted migration for conservation have been rare compared to experimental and inadvertent cases.
•Assisted migration of plants (particularly trees) was most common while for other taxa was uncommon.
•More research on assisted migration is needed, particularly on population- and community-level outcomes.

Abstract: Temperature rise due to climate change is putting many arctic and alpine plants at risk of extinction
because their ability to react is outpaced by the speed of climate change. We considered assisted species migration (ASM) and hybridization as methods to conserve cold-adapted species (or the genes thereof) and to minimize the potential perturbation of ecosystems due to climate change. Assisted species migration is the deliberate movement of individuals from their current location to where the species' ecological requirements will be matched under climate projections. Hybridization refers to crossbreeding of closely related species, where for arctic and alpine plants, 1 parent is the threatened cold-adapted and the other its reproductively compatible, warm-adapted sibling. Traditionally, hybridization is viewed as negative and leading to a loss of biodiversity, even though hybridization has increased biodiversity over geological times. Furthermore, the incorporation of warm-adapted genes into a hybrid may be the only means for the persistence of increasingly more maladapted, cold-adapted species. If approached with thorough consideration of fitness-related parameters of the source population and acknowl-edgement of the important role hybridization has played in shaping current biodiversity, ASM and hybridization could help save partial or whole genomes of key cold-adapted species at risk due to climate change with minimal negative effects on ecosystem functioning.

My point is there's different ways to quantify water scarcity. The maps in that Science paper seem much more realistic to me than Figure g in the figure you linked (where there is barely any scarcity in, idk, the Sahel or Eastern Africa). 

Water scarcity is largely addressed for the moment by depleting aquifers, which will not be able to go on forever: e.g., [Global peak water limit of future groundwater withdrawals ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-024-01306-w)

The conclusion you are citing deals with current water scarcity. Of course we could solve water scarcity. That's the sort of platitude you put in a paper - like, for climate change (""putting caps to CO2 emissions will be key.."" etc.). . But we are not really doing that, are we? Depleting aquifers, drying out endoreic lakes/seas, entire rivers...  Like, we could solve global poverty. Or pollution. Or global hunger.  So I guess there is no need to worry about those problems, or how they might get worse in the future, or how we are not doing anything/enough about them now - because there *are* solutions to them. What kind of circular reasoning is that? By the way,  saying ""caps to consumption + sharing' is not a technofix, that's demand destruction and rationing. Not quite the win you are thinking.

60 million people die every year, to place that in perspective.

No, we should not say they can not be solved - we should work to solve them.

Summary

* Trump climate comments this week 'raised some eyebrows' says Jeffrey Sachs
* Despite that, countries are not changing view of the risk
* Renewables costs sliding, he says

NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - U.N. special adviser on sustainability and Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs said the Trump administration's attacks on climate science have not impacted the commitment of other countries to reduce their emissions.

Multilateral action on sustainability issues, including climate change, is facing a tough moment.

Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly this week, U.S. President Donald Trump described climate change as the ""greatest con job"". The U.N. hosts its next round of global climate talks in Brazil in November.

At a Reuters NEXT Newsmaker event in New York during Climate Week, Sachs said while Trump's comments had ""raised some eyebrows,"" the rest of the world was ""moving forward quickly.""
""I have not heard from one president, at least directly - (and) I speak to many heads of state - I haven't heard from one this year that the U.S. abandonment of this issue under Trump is changing their view at all,"" Sachs said.

Sachs flagged the sliding cost of renewable energy, with solar power falling as low as 8 cents per watt.
That was ""frankly, the opposite of what Donald Trump claimed yesterday when he said fossil fuels are great and you're ruining your country going to renewables. It's false even on just the most basic cost calculus,"" he said.

As director of Columbia's Center for Sustainable Development, Sachs has been a long-time advocate of reform to institutions such as the World Bank to allow them to increase lending.

While a programme of reform is already underway, the institutions' shareholders - largely richer nations - have so far baulked at putting in fresh cash, pushing instead for them to squeeze more out of what they have.

Sachs said however that putting in more money wasn't a ""heavy lift,"" and that other countries such as China should also be given a greater role in the development bank system.",Economy-Fee5830,2,1758802875,25-09-2025 12:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nq58hd/countries_committed_to_climate_action_despite/ng4536z/

comment,ng40f02,t3_1nq4lzi,China is voluntarily giving up Developing Country status and benefits,"#WTO hails Chinese decision to forgo developing country benefits

GENEVA, Sept 24 (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization hailed a decision by China to forgo trade benefits from its status as a developing country, which the global body said would help make the trading system fairer and more balanced.

China's Premier Li Qiang announced on Tuesday that Beijing will no longer request so-called Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) benefits, which arise from its developing country status, in WTO negotiations on future deals.

Giving further details, a senior Chinese diplomat at WTO headquarters in Geneva said on Wednesday that China would continue to call itself a developing country, despite no longer seeking the SDT benefits.
WTO trade rules allow developing countries more leeway to use higher tariffs or subsidies to protect their industries.

##MOVE ADDRESSES 'LONGSTANDING U.S. COMPLAINT'

But with China having long since become the world's second largest economy, some trade partners, especially the United States, have said this is unfair. Washington has said reform of the global trading system is impossible unless big developing countries give up those benefits.

""This is a pivotal moment for the WTO. China's decision reflects a commitment to a more balanced and equitable global trading system,"" WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said in a statement.
WTO members are weighing sweeping reforms to revitalise the global trade body, which has been challenged by a wave of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

Keith Rockwell, a trade analyst at the Hinrich Foundation and former WTO communications director, told Reuters China's move could help its relations with Washington.

""It's certainly been a longstanding U.S. complaint, and if they are able to move off that, that is something that would be, I would think, very helpful,"" he said.

##CHINA 'WILL ALWAYS BE A DEVELOPING COUNTRY'

Li Yihong, senior delegate at China's mission to the WTO in Geneva, told a news conference that the decision to forgo the SDT benefits showed China's ""commitment to supporting the multilateral trading system"".

""This does not involve any change to China's status as a developing country and in the WTO as a developing member, whether within the WTO framework or in any other context,"" she said. ""China remains a key member of the global south and will always be a developing country.""

Xiankun Lu, former senior trade diplomat of China, told Reuters the Chinese move would ""put an end to the current debate about the rebalance of rights and obligations among major players of the WTO, at least for China.""

""Now the ball is in the court of other major players to demonstrate their responsibility and commitment to the system and its reform,"" he added.",Economy-Fee5830,27,1758801081,25-09-2025 11:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nq4lzi/china_is_voluntarily_giving_up_developing_country/ng40f02/

comment,ng3wn90,t3_1nq43us,Xi commits China to its first ever emissions targets,"**The Telegraph writes:**

Xi Jinping on Wednesday issued China’s first absolute targets for cutting emissions.

The landmark pledge from the world’s top polluter comes as the US doubles down on fossil fuels and Europe falters in its commitment to meeting targets.

Under the new plan, the Chinese president said his country will reduce economy-wide emissions by 7-10 per cent by 2035 relative to the year of the country’s peak emissions, believed to be 2025.

Observers said that while the absolute figure may seem modest, China has a record of under promising while over-delivering, driven by its green technology boom.

post,1npq1uf,,Please help me convince my father climate change is real,"Hey everyone, I recently had a heated discussion with my MAGA father about how he doesn’t believe in climate change because as he says: 40 years ago scientists said that by now things were going to be super disastrous and Florida was going to be under water but nothing has happened.
Im not sure if he’s partially correct and the reason not as much has happened because of efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, if scientists never actually said those things, or if there is some other explanation.  
Anyways, I dont expect to change his mind but if anyone has any sources or explanations that would address his claim, that would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks     

edit: Thank you everyone for the huge amount of responses and discussion. Lots of great resources and questions to ask that I hadn’t considered. To everyone saying that trying to change his mind is hopeless: I pretty much agree you. To everyone saying its fine that he thinks the way he does and I should just move on: you’re wrong. Its not okay for any father to tell his son that he’s brainwashed, crazy, fooled, etc. because his son choses to believe in scientific evidence. I say this not to elicit pity (my father has been the way he is for a very long time, ive come to expect it) but to share with you all an example of how tragic and extreme his type of conspiratorial thinking can be. The battle forward will be incredibly challenging, but is incredibly important. Know what you’re up against.

comment,ng17wwm,t3_1npq1uf,Please help me convince my father climate change is real,"Honestly, we’ve kinda had this nailed for about the last 40 years. The Charney Report in 1979 and the 1990 IPCC First Assessment Report both present the science that has been refined between now and then, but which has been basically unchallenged. We are pretty well on track for the predictions of those reports. 0.2 to 0.5 degrees of warming per decade in the 21st century.

He probably never read those reports… If he read anything back then, it was probably an inflammatory newspaper article picking some fringe contrarian study out of a hat, like “global cooling” because it made a good story, not because it was scientific consensus.

Even more likely than that, someone has convinced him that “they’re lying to you” about climate change, and told him that scientific consensus was saying Florida would be entirely underwater by 2010 or something. It’s a narrative which is difficult to break people out of.

It’s probably not super productive to keep at it with him. You can show him the reports, or the Wikipedia articles summarizing them, but he’s probably made up his mind.

In changing people’s minds, it’s best to understand that people shift slowly, and often harden with confrontation. It’s best not to expect him to change the moment you show him a study, and to not do anything that would make him defensive. You just being in his life, as a well informed, confident, rational person, believing the things you do, and being able to gently correct or redirect, chip away bit by bit over time, is probably your best bet.

Edit: just to add another data point, the 1990 report claims 3-10 cm per decade of sea level rise, about 20cm by 2030. That’s about two thirds of a foot, or 8 inches. They were not predicting Florida being entirely underwater by now.",EngineerAnarchy,54,1758755144,24-09-2025 23:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1npq1uf/please_help_me_convince_my_father_climate_change/ng17wwm/

Yeh, there were crazy news articles in 1985 predicting the future (in both directions), same as there are now.

There was absolutely not scientific consensus in 1985 that ""Florida was going to be underwater"" or that ""things would be super disastrous"" by 2025. It's also not true that as of today ""nothing has happened"".

For your own info, here's a summary of scientific consensus at various times across the past 50 years: 

[Scientific consensus on climate change - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus_on_climate_change)

Even by the mid-90s and early 00s, there was still considerable debate and testing of alternative reasons, including solar cycle and volcanic effects, among others. The turning points varied for people a great deal, but the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and Al Gore's ""Inconvenient Truth"" in 2006 covers roughly the period during which scientific consensus around global heating was growing beyond the point of responsible scientific debate. By around 2010-2015, it became virtually certain that observed temperature, ocean acidity and sea level effects are largely anthropogenic. This followed another turning point during the late 2000s, after scientific work on atmospheric carbon isotope ratios pointed clearly and unequivocally to combustion of fossil fuels.

I read an article; different issue; but the core was about changing hardened beliefs.  This fella that wrote the article was a devout Muslim.  Knew the science but could not accept Evolution.  As much as he looked for proof against it his attempts failed.  He ultimately became a Dr of biology and could no longer ignore the facts.  The jist of his article was what that meant to his life.  He was rejecting his clan; his friends and family.  He lost his wife.  Changing your views that your core group accept as gospel; can be life changing.  Maybe your Dads friends are so entrenched in a certain mindset they can’t accept anyone who thinks differently; it would change his life in ways you might not understand. If your not a believer in the scientific method; changing positions is on the level of religion. 

My father is maniacal about data.  If the data is good; the analysis follows the right methology ten he can’t ignore that.  He had Walter Demmings quote above his desk.  “In God we Trust; everyone else bring Data”.  So, he’s accepted in his 80s; conservative; not crazy; that yes we have a problem.  But he brings another data point to the table.  Changing behavior alone will not solve it in a meaningful time frame; we need hardcore remediation.

Imagine your garage is the planet. 
Inside the garage is plenty of air, and you're standing there, breathing just fine. But the garage is a bit hot and the door is closed, so you're stuck inside. You know, just like how we're all stuck inside the atmosphere of this planet?

Now, if climate change is real, the last thing you'd wanna do is run the engine of your car because eventually it's going to fill the garage, and you're gonna have a bad day.

But if it's fake, you should be able to run that engine all you want. And after all, it's hot in the garage. Remember?

Because that's all we're talking about! We're talking about emissions and whether they're bad for the people breathing that air. 

Now if you really believe it's not real, I see no reason for you not to run the car. Get your AC going... cool yourself down.
 
So how long are you going to run the car for? Let it run all day?

Or, deep down, do you maybe *already know* that doesn't make sense? Because everybody knows that it's a scenario that can be fatal! What you're having a hard time with is that the garage is just smaller than the planet.

You're trying to convince a willfully ignorant person to learn something. The topic doesn't matter. His inability to recognize that opinions aren't facts and that learning takes some form of effort does matter though.  Most sensible people recognize when they know nothing about a topic without ego. I don't know how to golf, cause I don't golf and don't care to learn. So I have no opinion on how golf is better than tennis because I've never engaged in it. Personally I disengage completely from stupid now. Even with family. You'll only drive yourself crazy trying to lower your own intellect to engage with someone at the level.

comment,ng35dog,t3_1npq1uf,Please help me convince my father climate change is real,"Sometimes facts and figures are too dry for people, and you need to appeal to the story telling side for them.

First we have to distinguish between scientific reports, which are long, dry and boring, and tabloid news reports, which like to hype everything. Unfortunately, 99% of people only get the tabloid media side of the story, so all we hear are ‘global cooling, global warming, floods, fires raging infernos!’. When none of this comes true like the media says, then we blame the science. But it’s the media over hyping things that are the problem. You can even say this IS an example of the ‘fake news media!’

Finally, you just have to explain that global warming takes generations to occur. If he’s even been skiing, or diving etc, just tell him those sites likely no longer exist. But it’s taken his whole lifetime for that to occur. But his grandkids will never get to experience it. And his great grandkids will suffer from crippling food prices, mass migration, and his great great grandkids will never get to eat a steak, or corn and will live in a time where there will be global wars raging non stop due to water insecurity.

Maybe he says ‘it’s too big, too complex’. Well, we don’t hear much about the hole in the ozone layer any more? It was mostly controlled - by smart changes.

Maybe he knows it’s real all along but doesn’t think he can make any difference. The biggest difference any of us can make is to stop reinforcing the lies. He wants a conspiracy?!

The sea water along the Gulf is 89 degrees and up along the Greenland coast, it's too warm to freeze sea ice. Thus, fresh water is disrupting the Thermohaline Circulation.

Prior studies showed that various forms of aerosol pollution have contributed a cooling effect towards climate change, and more recently it's thought that efforts to clean that pollution have gotten rid of that cooling effect and accelerated global warming.

Even if that's all bullshit in their eyes, the fact that the estimates given for when things are going to be even worse continue to get smaller should be a real fucking concern. Ex down from 40 years to 10

comment,nghtt0c,t3_1npq1uf,Please help me convince my father climate change is real,"I am old enough (63 y/o) to have experienced enough of life to know that 99% of topics that are controversial are motivated by money. It almost always goes back to money. If some person or organization is making a lot of money by promoting one side of a controversial subject, I am immediately suspicious. I also happen to have an engineering background. I am curious to a fault. Never take other’s word for it. Always investigate subjects that interest me for myself. That said, I always find it odd that climate change advocates only look back 100-150 years.   Why not go back 1,000 years? Why not go back 10,000 years? If I were to take a survey of who people will vote for in the next local election but I only poled ten households on my street, would that be a good sampling that would yield a more accurate prediction than if I poled ten houses on every street in my city? No. The larger the sampling, the more accurate the results/prediction. If we look back 500,000 to 800,000 years, we see that the global temperature has risen and fallen numerous times. The peaks of warming and cooling occur about every 90,000 - 110,000 years. Google “historic global temperature”. A number of charts will appear that show the temperature increase/decrease over time. The pattern of this increase is repeated, such that it is predictable. Looking at where the earth’s temperature is currently, we are within the repeated pattern. The temperature is not increasing at a rate that is more or less than that of previous cycles. In fact, the Earth is currently 2+ degrees F cooler than the last warming peak. One can make the argument that since the Industrial Revolution (about 140 years) man has increased the production of CO2’s released into the atmosphere. This hurts the atmosphere. I agree. When we discovered that coal and oil could power machinery, that is a definite increase in CO2’s. However, have you ever heard climate change people discuss forest fires? In grade school, we learned about photosynthesis. In it’s simplest, plants absorb CO2 and produce oxygen. When a tree burns, it releases all of the CO2 that it has “absorbed” during it’s lifetime. Today, when a lightning strike causes a forest fire in a remote wilderness, somewhere in the world, we have the ability to deliver “smoke jumpers” (via parachute) to the fire, no matter how isolated the fire is. We have the ability to supply these firefighters with food, water and equipment (via helicopters) while they battle the fire. Then, we have the ability to retrieve them after they have extinguished the fire (again via helicopter). Parachutes and helicopters are fairly recent inventions. 100 years ago, forest fires that were so isolated that humans could not reach them, would burn for weeks, months and even years before being extinguished by rain or some natural barrier (mountains or river). Large forest fire can release way more CO2 in a month than entire countries can with internal combustion engines. I would argue that our ability to fight remote forest fires is a huge net reduction in CO2 emissions. Aren’t you at least a little curious why this isn’t discussed? Why not?",HoldItBetweenUrKnees,1,1758987356,27-09-2025 15:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1npq1uf/please_help_me_convince_my_father_climate_change/nghtt0c/

comment,ngot3pv,t3_1npq1uf,Please help me convince my father climate change is real,"The Australian fires in 2019/20 were ….. next level horrendous.    

A third of the Australian Capital Territory burnt to the ground.    
The fires raged for 6 months.     
We in the capital were crazy lucky.   Those to the south, east, and west of us were not.      
It often was impossible to tell whether it was day or night:   It was just pitch black.    

10min outside was like smoking 30 cigs.   
The incidence of premature labour, still births, and miscarriages went through the roof.   
The smoke was pitch black.   Could not see the sun, had no idea what time of day it was.    Many days visibility was about an arm’s length, if even.   

For a huge area across 3 states:   We are the designated trauma hospital.     
Our ICU had to be evacuated, patients flown hundreds of miles.   The air  **inside**  our ICU had become so bad it was unsafe for patients. 


The area of the fires was about the size of Wisconsin:   That was the area completely burnt.    

For months the fire was just over the hill, a 5min drive away.   

From October 2019 to February 2020 I had the car packed, just in case.  Nervously looking at the orange night sky listening to the radio 24/7.    

At least 33 people died, including American firefighters. 

But worst of all were the animals:  over 3 billion animals perished.     
Check that:  over   **3,000,000,000**  animals   

The smell of burnt flesh, fur, and eucalypts.     

The SCREAMS of burnt animals as they were dying.    It’s a sound we will never be able to forget.    

Burnt birds falling out of the sky like rocks.     
When I tried to get some sleep, I could hear them falling on the roof:   clonk  •  clonk    
Every now and then scratching as the bird dragged itself across the roof.    
While I was just hoping for it to die already. 


 
There was so much suffering.   Day after day after day ….. for almost half a year.     
Over 3 billion dead animals.    

Animals completely burnt, screaming in agony.  Burnt birds falling out of the sky.   Entire species likely to have been completely wiped out.    
Death and pain and dying and agony ….. each and every day, for almost half a year.     

There is a movie about the 2019/20 Black Summer.    
It has nothing to do with climate change I think, it’s just a documentary about the fires.    

I haven’t watched it, I never will.   I got to the first burnt wombat and its screams:   I was curled up on the carpet, sobbing, hoping the screaming would stop.    

Nope, **DEFINITELY**(!)  not a movie for me!  

If you’d like I’ll find a link to the documentary for you. :o)   
I think it’s somewhere without a paywall or subscription.   

I honestly do not care whether he believes in climate change or not.   
It is entirely his choice!    

But:      
Over  3  BILLION  sentient creatures.   Dying in horrific agony and panic.   

Which side does he want to err on?   

Does he really want to be the kind of person who says:     
_”I don’t care about billions of sentient creatures and their suffering!   It would not cost me a thing to give a damn, but I still choose agony and pain and terror of BILLIONS!”_    

That documentary will show him  _’super disastrous’_  so bad he could not have imagined.      
And then some!      

Yes, he is partly correct:     
The Joe on the ozone layer was a huge concern when it became widely known in the 80s and 90s.     
It’s kinda right above us in Canberra.     

Back then we all changed our fridges and all spray cans were replaced and yadda yadda yadda.   
It was the whole  [CFC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon)  thing.

Note thats a DIFFERENT(!)  thing to climate change though!    

For the record:     
We are 750m / yds above sea.    Half-way up the Australian Alps.   
I a half Zulu.   I never used sunscreen anywhere in the world, never had a sunburn .        
Until Canberra!   
Shiiiiiiiit 

Happens to ALL of us:   
Whether from Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Mali, South Sudan, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Malawi, Botswana, Angola, Mauritius, Madagascar, …..      

We all had been wondering all our lives ehat a sunburn feels like.   Peeling off huge patches of skin looked bizarre!   

In Canberra we all learned the hard way just how much it sucks!  

Australia had the highest skin cancer rates in the world.   Young people on their early 20s die.    

But no:   The hole in the ozone layer is not directly linked to climate change.   Different phenomena. :o) 

I don’t know whether climate change is real or not.   
I don’t care, it makes no diff to me.   
Cause I burst into tears whenever I so much as think of the burnt flesh, the screams, the agony.   Dead creatures literally falling out the sky.   

I know beyond the shadow of a doubt which side I want to err on.   

Believing in climate change costs me absolutely nothing.   Why would I not go with the option that does not involve endless suffering?   

If he is Christian:   Why would he be careless about the horrofic deaths of over THREE BILLION sentient creatures?     

The river coming down from the mountains is usually shockingly cold.   That summer it was warmer than body temperature.   The night sky was all orange around us.   

If he does not care about billions of animals:   How about the American firefighters dying protecting our capital?     
We have not forgotten their sacrifice — what TF is wrong with him that he, as a MAGA, cares less about American lives than we Australians do? 

If he chooses to not care about any of above and he is Christian:   
Please tell him from me that it does not make any diff what he does anymore.    I know beyond the shadow of a doubt that Heaven is out of reach for him anyway.    

Anyone who does not care about the unfathomable agony of BILLIONS of God’s creatures:   He might as well be a serial killer, it would it make any diff.    
I know exactly where he will spend eternity.    

Whether he cares about his own soul and where it spends eternity:   That’s his call.  🤷🏽‍♀️

Sing out if you want the link to that documentary.   
Fair warning:   It is anything but easy watching. 

And I cannot express how grateful I am for the firefighters from around the world who came as helped us.    And lost their lives, like the brave Americans. 🫶🏽🙏🏽🫶🏽

comment,ngph96j,t3_1npq1uf,Please help me convince my father climate change is real,"Most people will tell you to throw them facts. DO NOT ASSUME IGNORANCE.   They didn't arrive at their conclusion by lack of reading and ""researching"". Instead what happened is that they arrived at their conclussions by absorbing contradictory facts without using their critical thinking. They outsourced their critical thinking to external sources who they shouldn't have trusted, but they are too deep into that. The way they have arrived at their conclusions is by trusting their feelings, if you attack what they know you are  implying that their feelings are incorrect and that is why they get defensive. 

Instead of fighting, calm yourself, control your own feelings and ask they calmly to explain their thinking. Why they don't think it is real, just listen and go fact by fact without fighting. Then go back another day and keep proving them with the evidence they need.

Also try to peek at what are their sources but never attack them directly. Instead use them by telling them rhat source also said ""X"" and ""Y"" and if they also velieve that. Most of the time that would sound reasonable to them, but some times it will not sound reasonable. That is the point where you want to help them practice critical thinking and exercise with them.

Also connect with them and help them practice critical thinking other ways, in more neutral topics. With some luck you can get them back. But don't forget this is a tug of war. At the same time you are pulling them in one direction, the media they are listening is pulling them to thw other side.

comment,ngrwvc2,t3_1npq1uf,Please help me convince my father climate change is real,"Well said. Gives me something to look at. I absolutely agree that gas and oil spend millions to spin their industry. The comparison to big tobacco is a good one. I don’t fly often but recently took a flight from the East coast to Colorado. While looking down from 30,000+ feet, the thing that struck me was the vastness of the areas of wilderness and farms. There is so much more area with no population than there are clusters of towns and cities. From a pure volumetric calculation, I can’t help but think how small we are. How small our CO2 production is compared to the volume of the atmosphere. CO2 represents 0.04% of the atmosphere. This includes natural release and man-created release. I get it, that number has increased dramatically (about 50%) in the last 140 years. One of the reasons given for global warming is deforestation. During the Dust Bowl of the 1930’s in the US, the civilian population planted something like 200 million trees and prairie grass to counteract the dry dusty surface created by poor farming practices. The U.S. government wanted to incentivize farming and offered to give land to non-farming civilians throughout the Mid West, if they agreed to farm the land. Not knowing about deep tilling of soil, crop rotation and other factors contributed to the loose dry topsoil that would get pick-up by the prairie winds and carried from as far as New Mexico, Colorado and Kansas to the East Coast. The fix was to have civilian groups plant grass and trees in an extremely short time at a minimum of cost. The government created the problem and then had to find a solution. That doesn’t ever happen. Point is, it was a relatively effective and cheap fix. Why don’t these same CC advocates talk about planting trees, like we did in the 30’s? Ever wonder why the fix for climate change always involves the U.S. giving billions of dollars to other countries (primarily European countries) to spend, as they see fit, to combat CC. If WWII taught us anything, it is that the U.S., through it’s ability to manufacture & produce at a rate that no other nation can comprehend, is better at solving large problems than anyone. How would giving France a trillion dollars over ten years help solve CC? Isn’t the average work week in Europe like 30 hours? Yeah, they’ll get it done.",HoldItBetweenUrKnees,1,1759119672,29-09-2025 04:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1npq1uf/please_help_me_convince_my_father_climate_change/ngrwvc2/

You can point out all the errors the deniers have in their explanations. You can point out that the deniers side has yet to produce a model that supports their predictions. Etc. Etc. Etc. It doesn't matter.

The deniers make ad hominem attacks, casuistic arguments, etc. They do not do experiments. They do not collect data. They use relative, poorly defined phrasing. They ignorE most of the published literature. 

Their counter arguments are off point. The deniers sound more like a cleric than a scientist.",mdcbldr,1,1759135574,29-09-2025 08:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1npq1uf/please_help_me_convince_my_father_climate_change/ngsoxfz/

Basically its like making you pay a fine to do what youre going to do anyway. People are still going to fly in planes. People are still going to drive vehicles ran off nonrenewables. The difference will be the government will just have an excuse to charge you more. Like the Paris climate accord where everyone is getting charged a carbon tax.

Unlike religion or conservatives, which when wrong, just denies it. There’s a reason universities skew liberal. The fundamental difference between a liberal and a conservative is being able to admit youre wrong. 

2. It doesn’t matter what the facts are. American conservatism has transcended its usual shared-character-flaw into an identity complex. If you convinced him climate change is real, he would then decide it’s a good thing. Anything but abandon his identity - his safe space.

comment,ngao345,t3_1npq1uf,Please help me convince my father climate change is real,"Back in 1995 I had to do a what was essentially a research paper for English 4. We could pick the topic so I picked the Ozone Layer.. back in those days my buddy and I were listening to Rage Against the Machine and I was worried about the planet. 

Anyway, I dug deep into as much literature as I could find about the depleted ozone layer and went to library after library all across about a 50-mile radius, because back then we didn't have the same access as we do today with the internet.  

I read magazine articles and encyclopedias, anything I could find. I was going to make a difference with my research. I watched the news when Al Gore would do interviews you name it. 

Fast forward a couple of months and literally the only information anywhere about the Ozone was short articles about Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) the stuff primarily used in aerosol cans, they were known for their role in Ozone depletion. 

Well, I wrote my paper and had clipped newspaper articles all barely covering a thousand words. This is after months of research no real evidence about the Ozone, no real explanation or solutions just article after article stating aerosols were bad. 

Al Gore wouldn't shut up about the Ozone and here I am studying and researching everything I could to help stop this culprit that was going to destroy our planet in the next ten years.

Well, guess what they are still saying the sky is falling and that climate change is going to end the world in the next decade,  that's been 30 years now. Nothing has happened. Absolutely nothing at all. 

It seems like every 10 years we are just weeks away from the earth ending due to something that the humans have caused yet we are still here. 

How is it up to America to throw Billions of dollars to save the planet while other countries like China and India just keep throwing trash into the oceans? There are no regulations in other countries but the American taxpayer with their hero complex is somehow taking up the slack for 95% of the rest of the planet? 

Now that I'm grown and realize that all I can do is my part and not expect anyone to feel like I do about a certain subject I just try to stay mindful not to throw trash out the windows while driving. I don't buy plastic water bottles or soda bottles. When I was younger I would go pick up trash off the ditches in my neighborhood. All anyone can do is their part. The American Government can't fix it if every other country on the planet isn't doing its part as well.

Fast forward to 2025, do I think cow farts are causing climate change? NO. Do I think EVs and solar panels will stop climate change? No. The climate temperature hasn't changed much in hundreds of years it has fluctuations and the earth makes its adjustment and we carry on.

Until the same people who complain about climate make a drastic change in their personal lives I will not take any of them seriously.  You're preaching while using a thousand-dollar phone, driving a gas-guzzling car or truck, drinking from plastic bottles, eating from plastic plates, flying across the country for vacations, eating fast food from paper and Styrofoam, using makeup tested on animals, protesting with signs from cutting down trees, and leaving trash in your wake.

Climate models have changed drastically over the years (since about 1970s). The primary continuous variable that All climate models base their precision and accuracy on is Global Surface Temperature trends. This is THE primary metric.

Climate model accuracy, with respect to predicting global surface temperatures, has remained virtually unchanged. Models 30 years are more or less as accurate as models of today are.

You don’t need to convince your father. What you should do, is look to meet in the middle.

Does he believe the world is going to end (in our lifetime)?

The problem, and climate science is no exception, is the loudest people in the room, are the ones who also over sensationalize and exaggerate their claims.

40 years ago we were in-fact told Florida WILL be under water and at that time, lobbyists and activists pushed for IMMEDIATE policy changes (just like any lobbyist, they want change NOW). 40 years ago we were told global warming (now rebranded as “climate change”) would destroy the global food supply chain by the 90s and we’d virtually run out of food. We were told in the late 70s-80s that a mini ice age was going to occur in the 90s-2000s

There are billions of dollars to be made here. Climate activists and scientists WILL sensationalize AND exaggerate outcomes, to drive investment.  Period. They’re no better than anyone else in any other industry. No one is more morally superior than any other groups.

comment,ngi33v4,t1_nghtt0c,Please help me convince my father climate change is real,"The long climate cycles you mention are real - we can see them in ice cores going back 800,000+ years. But those slow shifts are driven by Earth’s orbital changes and happen over tens of thousands of years. What’s different now is the speed: in just 150 years, global temps have risen +1.3C, about 10x faster than the natural pace. That’s why scientists say today’s warming can’t be explained by natural cycles alone.

And yes, forest fires release CO2, but that’s not ignored. The key point: over centuries, forests regrow and reabsorb much of that carbon, so it’s mostly part of the short-term carbon cycle. Fossil fuels are different - they add carbon that’s been locked underground for millions of years, tipping the balance upward. That’s why the atmospheric CO2 concentration is now higher than at any point in those 800,000 years.

Suspicion about money cuts both ways. Renewable energy companies make money, sure, but so do oil and coal corporations - on a far bigger scale. The science doesn’t hinge on who profits; it’s based on physical measurements of gases, temperatures, and ice.

We were supposed to be swallowed by glaciers in the 80s, have to live underground by the 2000s, yadda, yadda

""Global cooling"" was only ever a minority scientific position in response to what most scientists thought would be a temporary mid-century slight cooling (caused by increased aerosols etc.). Even in the 70s most scientists working in relevant fields expected warming to dominate eventually and any scientific support for cooling had completely fizzled out by the end of that decade.

The reason you remember it is that it was picked up by the media and given more prominence than it deserved. You can be forgiven for being misled at the time, because information about things like this was much harder to come by for the average person. You don't have so much of an excuse now though.

As for ""global warming"" vs ""climate change"", it's not a ""repackaging"". Global warming has continued. Climate change is what happens if you get sustained changes in temperature. It's a _consequence_ of global warming. This isn't a difficult thing to understand unless you have very limited mental capacity.

That's nonsense, as science never said that.

&nbsp;

The fossil fuel industry had been the most profitable industry in the history of money, and it's now clear that they had lied to, betrayed and deceived the government and public for decades. Plus, not known until a few years ago, ExxonMobil had conducted its own climate research (in the 1970s and 1980s) and not only arrived at the same primary conclusions as current climate science, but also:

- in 1982 Exxon accurately modelled and predicted the global temperature by 2020

- Exxon's own scientists also showed that if the burning of fossil fuels continued to significantly increase then there would be ""Globally Catastrophic Effects""

&nbsp;

Climate scientists are paid a pittance in comparison to oil executives. Or do you think those 1000s of scientists and professors are too dumb to realise that they could make vastly more money by working in the fossil fuel industry or for finance?

comment,ngi1dph,t1_ng17v6j,Please help me convince my father climate change is real,"Climate science has accurately predicted the increase in global temperature, and have also accurately predicted that:

- Atmospheric water vapour concentration would increase by 7% for every +1C increase in temperature - and that's why flooding has worsened around the world

- Snow cover and ice has retreated around the world, with > 98% of the world's glaciers are in decline

- Sea level rose by 1.2mm/year during the 20th century and has accelerated to its current 5mm/year (which is an inch every 5 years!)

- Hurricanes have become worse, with many records broken in recent years

- Wildfires have worsened on all continents (minus the Antarctic), and worsened in places from Siberia, to Asia, to Africa, Australia, Canada, the US and south America

- Droughts have become worse

- The world's warmest decades in increasing order are: 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s

comment,ngkzprz,t1_ngi33v4,Please help me convince my father climate change is real,"Thank you for your measured response. Thanks for actually reading my post. I never suggested that I was only suspicious of one side. I am suspicious of anyone who profits. Ralph Nader was a huge advocate for vehicle safety in the 1960’s, 70’s & 80’s. He was talking about airbags in cars in the 1970’s. Don’t think I ever used a seat belt in the 70’s. Nader was getting some attention at the time. The car manufacturers hated him because they knew that if some of the mandates he was suggesting were implemented, it would increase the cost of their cars exponentially. They offered him a lot of money and positions in their companies just to shut him up. He never took their money. He could have become very wealthy but stood on his principles. Quick story about “science”. Turns out scientists are people too. I own a small commercial construction company. About 7-8 years ago I was having lunch with our insurance agent. His company was started by his father and is still family owned. Mike is a great guy and has been our agent for 20+ years. We talked about where we both went to college, to which I said, “guess you already knew that you would be selling insurance when you graduated.” He surprised me by informing me that he never wanted to be in the family business. He grew up on the water and his lifelong dream was to become a marine biologist. That is what he went the school for and in-fact he worked as a marine biologist for 10 years for a company in Virginia that did research in and around the Chesapeake Bay. Said he loved it but had to quit because he fell in love, got married and wanted to have kids. I took that to mean that there must be more money in insurance than in marine biology. He explained that marine biology is primarily a research science. The vast majority of research sciences are funded by grants. These grants can be from private, state or federal funding. Often, the grants are for a year or two and must be continually evaluated and approved for further funding in the future. Means that you don’t always know if you will have a paying job next year. That’s fine for a single guy but doesn’t offer stability if you want to raise a family. The pessimist in me had to ask, “based on that, is it beyond the realm of possibility that a researcher would skew their data to support the results that the provider of the grant may want to see?” His response, “happens every day and the biggest cash cow is climate change.” Said every researcher that is studying CC knows the quickest way to get your funding yanked, is to suggest that man-made CO2’s may not contribute as significantly as we suspected. Said he saw it first hand with his employer. Woman that owned the company was a single mother with a mortgage and a car payment. At the end of a two year study on a particular microbe, her conclusion was that manufacturing run-off was the primary cause of the microbe disappearing in the Bay. Mike said that her conclusion was not even close to being supported and he refused to sign his name to it. She absolutely did it for the money.

The historical cycle graphs don’t support the suggestion that temperature is rising at a rate that is 10x faster than previous cycles. Yes, I know what “scientists” say but my eyes tell me something different. Their assessment would carry more weight with me if they argued that the temp graphs were inaccurate.",HoldItBetweenUrKnees,1,1759025425,28-09-2025 02:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1npq1uf/please_help_me_convince_my_father_climate_change/ngkzprz/

They’re not mutually exclusive. Just because your model has changed DOES NOT mean your predictive variables will change.

The goal of all climate models is to PRIMARILY predict global surface temperatures. Thats the goal. Predict global surface temperatures.

Climate models have changed drastically. Have you seen a climate model before?  Would you even know how to interpret one? 

Very first model (1967): “Thermal Equilibrium of the Atmosphere with a Given Distribution of Relative Humidity”

Most recent model used widely across the globe (2021):
“Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)”

Go read those papers and come tell me that “models haven’t changed drastically” - spoiler. They have. I know you won’t read them. And I doubt you could get through the paragraph before your brain melts because it’s not a scratch and sniff.

Climate change is real. The globe is getting warmer YoY. So what am I supposedly have bought into exactly?

What I don’t buy, is that the world is going to end. Ya… give it a few hundred thousand years. I’m not gonna hold my breath though.

comment,ngm51oh,t1_ngkzprz,Please help me convince my father climate change is real,"Ok, one key thing that stands out in the data is that every single major meteorological agency shows very rapid recent warming. Since the 1970s the rate has been about +0.18C per decade, and it’s now closer to +0.23C ([The Japanese Meteorological Agency, NASA, NOAA, Berkeley Earth, the Met Office, etc](https://berkeley-earth-wp-offload.storage.googleapis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/03231659/ComparisonModern-2023-1.png)). If that pace had been running for the last thousand years, we’d be sitting at something like +18C warmer today - which clearly hasn’t happened. That’s one of the ways scientists can see that the current spike is unusual and not just part of the long natural cycles we know from the ice core records.

&nbsp;

Another piece that I find striking is just how small the temperature difference is between states of the planet: only about -4.5°C separates pre-industrial times from the last ice age. Right now we’re already about +1.3°C warmer, with most of that jump happening since the 1970s, and the projections point toward +3C or more by 2100. That would be heading to make the Earth as warm in the positive direction as the last ice age was cold.

&nbsp;

On the 'money' side of things, your suspicion makes sense - industries do try to protect their profits. That’s been documented many times (lead in gasoline and paint, asbestos, DDT, tobacco, etc). In fact, one of the most interesting historical finds was that ExxonMobil’s own scientists in the 70s and 80s produced internal reports that aligned almost exactly with today’s climate science - but the company chose to run PR campaigns casting doubt instead, very similar to Big Tobacco. That’s why Exxon facing lawsuits under the same RICO laws that were used against tobacco companies.

So it’s not that 10s of thousands of scientists and researchers around the world is on the take - it’s more that powerful industries have a long track record of muddying the waters when the science threatens their bottom line.",fungussa,1,1759045351,28-09-2025 07:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1npq1uf/please_help_me_convince_my_father_climate_change/ngm51oh/

There are many candidates for unusually cold years sometime between 1700 - 1899. Typically they're the result of [volcanic global cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_winter?wprov=sfla1). It could be the [Lakí eruption of 1783,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbressan/2015/06/08/this-1783-volcanic-eruption-changed-the-course-of-history/), [the 1815 Tambora eruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1815_eruption_of_Mount_Tambora), or the [1883 eruption of Krakatoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1883_eruption_of_Krakatoa). 


Or maybe it was [the great frost of 1709](https://archive.is/SvB8S), which can be partially but not entirely explained by the 1707 and 1708 eruptions of Mount Fuji, and Mount Santorini and Mount Vesuvius. 


Either way, these things are knowable. Denialists count on people's ignorance about them. The truth is that there was a scientifically grounded concern about particulate pollution causing a similar cooling effect to that of volcanic eruptions. Then the Clean Air Act was passed and particulate pollution dropped rapidly, easing those concerns at the same time that it became clear that greenhouse gas emissions were rising and would likely overwhelm any cooling caused by particulates.",SallyStranger,2,1758805330,25-09-2025 13:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1npq1uf/please_help_me_convince_my_father_climate_change/ng4bzkn/

Accuracy. Consistent accuracy when comparing models to actual climate numbers. The models are more complex, but they say the same thing: pumping CO2 into the atmosphere causes drastic climate change.

The EPA reports flooding is becoming more frequent along much of the U.S. coastline, including the East Coast, as relative sea level rises due to climate change.

.NASA’s sea level research highlights the U.S. East Coast as one of the “hot spots” likely to be most affected by rising sea levels, increasing risk from storm surges and high-tide flooding that could force managed retreat from low-lying coastal areas in coming decades.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also warns that severe flooding risks will increase for low-lying coasts and cities globally, with high emissions possibly resulting in extreme sea level rise by 2100.

Climate adaptation scientists like Emma Gildesgame warn of the need for “managed retreat”—relocating coastal infrastructure further inland—as a strategic response to the threat of future flooding along the East Coast.",theagricultureman,0,1758839777,25-09-2025 22:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1npq1uf/please_help_me_convince_my_father_climate_change/ng7jq1l/

Science didn't say that. The rate of sea level rise during the 20th century averaged 1.2mm/year and it's accelerated to its current 5mm/year. So is simply wouldn't have been be possible over several decades.

However, in 1988 the renowned climate scientist, James Hansen, **informally speculated** how much sea levels would rise in 40 years if CO2 levels were **doubled** - ie if CO2 was at 703ppm, and given that level of CO2 and therefore the degree of warming (around +4C warmer) sea levels could've risen quite significantly.

So you merely had limited knowledge of what was said.

Nuclear is good, but solar is already the cheapest form of energy in history, with manufacturing costs halving every 5 years, and wind is not far behind and storage is also seeing dramatic reduction in costs.

And since solar radiation has been in slow decline since the 1970s, then if it weren't for mankind's activities then the Earth would've been slowly cooling since that time.

And interestingly, there are only 3 factors that can change the Earth's temperature:

- Changes in solar radiation (either changes in the sun's output, changes in the Earth's orbit)

- Changes in the Earth's albedo (reflectivity, eg by land use change, changes in snow/ice cover, particulates from volcanic eruptions etc)

Great point, and absolutely correct.  We add 100 times more CO2 to the atmosphere than volcanos.  The oceans and land systems absorb the about the same amount as they emit (actually absorb a bit more than they emit)

> Even if they can somehow accurately measure co2 from 15 million years ago, it’s still a very narrow period of time.

Thanks, another good point.  They use methods like tree rings to measure CO2.  Here is a graph of the last 66 million years

The total accumulative cost of ethanol subsidies in the U.S. is difficult to pinpoint precisely, but past estimates suggest significant figures. For instance, the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit, a key federal subsidy, cost taxpayers $5.7 billion in foregone revenues in 2011 alone.  Ethanol was to reduce foreign imports.

comment,ng0wpxk,t3_1nppd6z,'Green revolution' organisation is distributing climate-change-resistant wheat seeds,"#**'Green revolution' organisation is distributing climate-change-resistant wheat seeds**

The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), founded by Green Revolution pioneer Norman Borlaug, is adapting its decades-old crop breeding techniques to help farmers combat climate change. The Mexico-based organization has distributed free climate-resilient wheat seeds to millions of farmers across 40 million hectares, including Indian farmer Pritam Singh, who saw his crop devastated by record 127°F temperatures in 2022 but achieved exceptional yields in 2024 using the hardier varieties.

CIMMYT uses conventional crossbreeding methods to develop wheat strains that can withstand extreme heat, drought, and unpredictable weather patterns. Researchers select parent crops with desirable genetic traits and intercross them over several cycles to create more resilient varieties. Since 2011, the organization has focused specifically on developing crops that can survive climate change impacts, working with partners in 88 countries.

This work is becoming increasingly critical as heat waves intensify globally. In India, which produces wheat for 35% of the world's population, temperatures are rising earlier and lasting longer than normal. Scientists estimate that each additional degree of global warming will reduce food production by 120 calories per person daily due to lower crop yields, with wheat-growing regions in northern India particularly vulnerable.

The organization has helped develop over 2,600 climate-resilient crop varieties in the past decade through partnerships with institutions like the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. However, challenges remain, including soil degradation, water scarcity, and the limitations of what breeding can achieve against extreme temperature increases. While Singh's 2024 harvest succeeded even at 46°C, he remains cautious about whether these varieties can handle even higher temperatures in the future.",Economy-Fee5830,1,1758751268,24-09-2025 22:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nppd6z/green_revolution_organisation_is_distributing/ng0wpxk/

A comprehensive new study published in PLOS Climate reveals that meeting Paris Agreement targets could deliver economic benefits rather than costs, while uncontrolled climate change would significantly constrain global prosperity by the end of the century.

## The Economic Case for Climate Action

Researchers from Cambridge and the International Monetary Fund analyzed economic data from 174 countries, finding that adhering to Paris Agreement goals would generate a 0.25% boost to global GDP per capita by 2100 compared to current warming trends. This challenges the common perception that climate action necessarily comes at an economic cost.

The study's key insight lies in understanding that our current economic growth already reflects decades of climate damage. Since pre-industrial times, 1.2°C of warming has already cost the global economy an estimated 2% of GDP – roughly $1.6 trillion. This damage is embedded in our baseline economic performance.

## Why Paris Compliance Boosts Growth

Under the Paris-aligned scenario (limiting warming to about 2°C above pre-industrial levels), emissions would decline rapidly and global temperature increases would slow to approximately 0.01°C per year. This deceleration of warming actually enhances economic performance by reducing the ongoing stress that continuously rising temperatures place on economies.

""The critical factor in determining income losses is not the absolute level of temperature but rather changes in its trend,"" the researchers explain. When warming trends stabilize rather than accelerate, economies can perform better than under business-as-usual conditions.

## The Cost of Inaction

Without significant mitigation efforts, the study projects global GDP per capita could be 10-24% lower by 2100 than it would be under slower warming scenarios. These aren't absolute economic declines – economies would still grow substantially – but represent massive foregone prosperity.

Under high-emissions pathways like SSP5-8.5, where fossil fuel use continues expanding, global temperatures could rise by 4-5°C above pre-industrial levels. This would create persistent economic drag as countries continuously adapt to worsening climate conditions.

The study found that climate variability amplifies these losses, with economic impacts ranging from 12-14% globally when accounting for increased weather volatility that accompanies rising temperatures.

## Uneven Global Impact

The research reveals stark disparities in climate economic impacts. Countries in hotter climates and lower-income nations face disproportionately higher losses – potentially 30-60% above the global average. However, even colder countries aren't spared, as they experience faster rates of temperature increase despite having somewhat lower economic sensitivity per degree of warming.

## Adaptation Has Limits

While the study shows adaptation measures can reduce climate damages, they cannot eliminate the fundamental economic drag of continuously rising temperatures. The researchers tested various adaptation speeds, from rapid (10-year adjustment periods) to extremely slow (100-year periods), finding that even fast adaptation leaves significant economic impacts.

""Adaptation presents a viable pathway to reducing the detrimental long-term growth effects of climate change, but it falls short of completely eliminating these impacts,"" the authors conclude.

## The Bottom Line

This research reframes climate economics from ""expensive action versus cheap inaction"" to ""investment in better economic performance versus accepting continued economic degradation."" Since climate damages are already constraining growth, ambitious mitigation doesn't just avoid future costs – it could actively improve economic outcomes.

The study's findings suggest that meeting Paris Agreement targets represents not just environmental necessity, but sound economic policy. By stabilizing the warming trend that's already dragging on global prosperity, climate action could unlock better growth trajectories for the decades ahead.

As policymakers weigh climate investments, this research provides compelling evidence that the question isn't whether we can afford to act on climate change, but whether we can afford not to.

comment,ng05cx8,t3_1nplwwd,China commits to a 10% emissions cut by 2035,"#**China's New Climate Commitment**

China announced a commitment to reduce its climate pollution by 7-10% from peak levels over the next decade. This falls short of the 30% reduction the Biden administration had sought, but represents a significant move given China is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases.

**Key Points:**

- **Timing matters**: China had previously pledged to peak emissions ""around"" 2030, but analysis suggests this peak may have already occurred, five years ahead of schedule
- **Leadership vacuum**: With the US exiting the Paris Climate Agreement under Trump, China is expected to take a larger leadership role at upcoming climate summits
- **Policy divergence**: While Trump calls climate change a ""con job"" and promotes fossil fuels, Xi Jinping emphasized renewable energy as ""the trend of our time""
- **Clean energy dominance**: Despite the modest emissions target, China is far ahead globally in renewable energy, currently building 510 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity and planning to reach 3,600 gigawatts total
- **Mixed reception**: Experts view the commitment as politically cautious but note China's strong economic position to drive climate action forward, even as environmentalists wanted more ambitious targets

The commitment is seen as consequential because China's actions will largely determine the global climate trajectory, especially with reduced US engagement in international climate efforts.",Economy-Fee5830,23,1758743041,24-09-2025 19:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nplwwd/china_commits_to_a_10_emissions_cut_by_2035/ng05cx8/

You should be very careful how you interpret trade related emissions. If a low emissions country trades with a high emissions country and they trade a specific item 1 to 1, the low emissions country will increase their consumption based emissions, yet there was no offshoring of emissions. So an increasing global trade and globalized supply chains look worse for low emissions countries if they increasing their trades with high emissions countries, even without offshoring.",learningenglishdaily,0,1758785129,25-09-2025 07:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nplwwd/china_commits_to_a_10_emissions_cut_by_2035/ng374cv/

comment,nfzjmrt,t3_1npj5ck,Brazil proposes $125 billion Tropical Forests Forever scheme which would pay countries and indigenous people to preserve forests,"# Brazil proposes $125 billion Tropical Forests Forever scheme which would pay countries and indigenous people to preserve forests

Brazil has unveiled an ambitious $125 billion global initiative to protect tropical forests by paying countries and indigenous communities to keep their forests standing, marking a potentially transformative approach to combating climate change and deforestation.

President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF) at a United Nations event in New York on Tuesday, positioning Brazil as the first country to commit funding with a $1 billion pledge. The innovative scheme represents Brazil's flagship initiative ahead of hosting the COP30 climate summit in the Amazonian city of Belem in November.

## How the scheme works

The TFFF operates as an endowment fund that invests in low-risk assets and channels returns to tropical forest nations through annual payments of up to $4 per hectare of standing forest. Countries must maintain deforestation rates below 0.5 percent annually to qualify for payments, with penalties imposed for forest loss and degradation.

Crucially, at least one-fifth of the resources will flow directly to Indigenous peoples and local communities, recognizing their vital role as forest guardians. The fund covers more than 1.1 billion hectares of tropical forest across 73 developing countries, with the Amazon, Congo, and Borneo-Mekong basins accounting for 80 percent of the world's remaining tropical forests.

## Building international support

""Brazil will lead by example,"" Lula declared, urging international partners to make ""equally ambitious contributions"" to make the fund operational by COP30. ""This is not charity. It is an investment in humanity and in the planet against the threat of devastation by climate chaos.""

The initiative has already garnered significant backing from major economies. China's environment minister Huang Runqiu praised Lula's leadership and pledged Beijing's support, marking a notable shift as China positions itself as a climate finance provider rather than recipient. Norway, the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States, France, and the United Arab Emirates have also signaled support.

Several tropical forest nations including Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Indonesia, and Malaysia have endorsed the scheme. The Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization backed the fund in August, while the Brics bloc issued a joint declaration supporting it at their Rio de Janeiro summit in July.

## Ambitious funding targets

Policymakers envision the TFFF requiring an initial $25 billion from governments and major philanthropies to attract an additional $100 billion from private investors. This structure would create the full $125 billion needed to make meaningful payments to forest-preserving nations worldwide.

The fund represents a novel approach to climate finance, providing predictable, long-term resources rather than one-off grants or loans. By operating as an endowment, it aims to create sustainable funding streams that could continue indefinitely as long as forests remain protected.

## Climate and economic significance

Tropical forests play a critical role in climate regulation, biodiversity conservation, and supporting indigenous livelihoods. The TFFF addresses a key challenge in climate policy: creating economic incentives for developing countries to preserve forests rather than clear them for agriculture or development.

As one UAE official noted, the initiative marks ""an innovative global south-led"" approach to climate finance, potentially reshaping how the international community funds conservation efforts. Norway's climate minister Andreas Bjelland Eriksen emphasized the need to ""quickly expand the number of sponsor countries"" for the fund to reach its full potential.

The scheme's success could provide a model for other conservation initiatives while demonstrating that developing countries can lead innovative climate solutions. With COP30 approaching, the TFFF represents Brazil's major contribution to global climate action and could set new standards for international environmental cooperation.",Economy-Fee5830,15,1758736667,24-09-2025 17:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1npj5ck/brazil_proposes_125_billion_tropical_forests/nfzjmrt/

252 mm rain was dumped on the city in a matter of 7 hours by a cloud column 7 km tall. As usual, the streets got flooded and people had to wade through waters that were knee deep at some places and chest deep in others.

8 people died of electrocution from street lamps, as they were walking through the flooded streets. The concerned department is asked to pay for compensation. That is the best we can do.

Climate change is not giving cryptic signs, here and there, to wake us up; it is holding a poster in our face which reads: ""You are all going to die"". But we are not taking this threat seriously. We will continue with our pathetic lives, in which festivals like Navratri fill some joy and colours. We don't want anything to ruin that for us.

The climate within us is already rotten and has brought us on the brink of a complete mental breakdown, which no amount of sex and fast food can stop. So don't disturb us with news that we may not see the end of this century.

post,1np3lb5,,"If you don't care about global warming, then you should at least care about local warming.","Here's something that might change your perspective on climate data: **your local area is probably warming faster than you think**.

I built a historical weather data platform ([historicaltemperature.org](https://historicaltemperature.org/)) that lets you compare today's temperature with the same date going back 50+ years. What I discovered was eye-opening.

# What the data shows:

🌡️ **Your city's warming trend**: Most locations show clear warming patterns over decades, not centuries

📈 **Real numbers, not projections**: This isn't climate modeling - it's actual recorded temperature data from meteorological stations

🎯 **Personal relevance**: Instead of abstract global averages, see exactly how YOUR neighborhood has changed

# Try it yourself:

1. Go to [historicaltemperature.org](https://historicaltemperature.org/)
2. Enter your city, or allow access to the local location.
3. See how today compares to the same date in previous decades.

# What makes this interesting:

* **50+ years of data** for most global locations
* **Daily comparisons** \- not just annual averages
* **Multiple time ranges** \- weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly analysis
* **Bilingual support** (English/Chinese)
* **Mobile-friendly** interface

# Some surprising findings:

* Many locations show 2-4°C warming over 50 years
* Some ""cold"" days today were average 30 years ago

Whether you're a climate skeptic or activist, the local data for your area might surprise you. It's one thing to hear about global warming in abstract terms - it's another to see that December 15th in your hometown is now 3°C warmer than it was in 1975.

We are in an interglacial in an ice age.  When we leave the current interglacial we will be in a glacial period about 7C cooler than the Holocene, and still in an ice age.

I already explained this to you.

The glacials are also referred to as ice ages.

>An ice age is a term describing two distinct but related long periods of time when the reduction in the temperature of Earth's surface and atmosphere, resulting in the presence or expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers. Earth's climate alternates between icehouse and greenhouse periods based on whether there are glaciers on the planet or not. Earth is currently in an icehouse period called Quaternary glaciation.[1] Individual pulses of cold climate within an icehouse period are termed glacial periods (glacials, glaciations, glacial stages, stadials, stades, or colloquially, ice ages), and intermittent warm periods within an icehouse period are called interglacials or interstadials.[2] Both icehouse and glacial periods are commonly referred as ice age.

comment,nfv56yq,t3_1noxrjh,evidence for and against it being “too late”?,"So it's probably too late for 1.5C since that would require a lot of effort and money globally to make happen, but from what I've read 2C is still very attainable. It still requires a lot of work to get done. We need to transistion our massive energy system from fossil fuels to green energy in 25 years. There's some hurdles to this and this is where people get very doomerist. 


1. 100% green electric grids


2. Electrify fossil fuel processes (cars, trains, planes, heating). This neccesitates larger electrical grids


3. Reduce consumption where we can't eliminate emissions


4. Carbon capture excess we can't eliminate. Very challenging in terms of cost/politics


5. Fight existing fossil fuel interests


6. AI data centers require more electricity so this also adds to 1&2 being challenging






On the other hand, solar, wind, and batteries(storage, but allows more solar/wind) are the cheapest new energy to add to the grid. And they will likely just get cheaper. EVs are getting better and cheaper. And catching on globally. And technology just gets bettet over time. ",Apprehensive_Tea9856,10,1758673341,24-09-2025 00:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1noxrjh/evidence_for_and_against_it_being_too_late/nfv56yq/

I think what you’re really getting at is security of global supply chains and access to food, water, energy and shelter where you specifically live. Still, for some people it’s already “too late”, so the only evidence I could see as valid (for it not being too late) would be the fact there are people continuing on in other places.

comment,nfvz0j6,t3_1noxrjh,evidence for and against it being “too late”?,"Once the costs start to mount up for coping with climate change, then the cost of taking action will look exceptionally attractive. The result is that we'll end up in a climate between today's and the ""to late"" possibility. 

The question has been whether there is a ""tipping point"" where the climate naturally slides towards hotness beyond a certain point. But this question doesn't hold water in light of the rapid technological advances that we're making and the major shifts currently underway for renewables. As a technologist, I believe it's possible to engineer enough of a cooling effect to ""Stop the Slide"" as the billboards and advertising jingles will decree about twenty years from now. Rooftops will all be painted white and light colored asphalt shingles will adorn houses. Roads will have nanocrystalline reflective material impregnated in the top layers of asphalt. Many roads will be ripped up and replaced with high speed rail. Mountain sides at higher elevations that used to be home to glaciers will have reflective polymer spread across their surface. Huge vats of algae will be grown in vertical farms, powered with free renewable power (when the wind blows at night), and the result will be packed underground (a reliable and cost effective carbon sequestration). 

Despite all of this, I believe we'll see ocean levels about 6-9 feet (about 2-3 meters) higher than today and most southern and gulf coastal areas of the U.S. depopulated as a result of higher seas and more intense hurricanes. The memory of what has been lost will propel these voters to complete the decarbonization process of the economy and put us on a more sustainable path. The 10's of millions of people that are displaced by the hot bulb effect in the southern-midwest U.S. will complete the voting shift.

Reality often is the messy result of the best and worst. It's difficult to predict exactly where we'll land, but if anything humans are ingenious and collectively courageous when faced with significant adversity.

Climate change combined with biodiversity loss combined with air pollution combined with water pollution combined with things wrong we haven’t discovered yet combined with habitat destruction combined with top soil loss combined with so on and so on. 

So many of our problems would be much easier to deal with if it weren’t for all of the everything else exasperating them, all of these problems are made worse by everything else. The dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico or the Dead Sea caused by nutrient runoff from agriculture would not be nearly as bad of a problem if we hadn’t also killed all of the filter feeders in these ecosystems with trawling, for instance. 

You need to think about all of these things as systems, you need to think about interdependence, and yet it can be hard to wrap your head around everything. I think it’s often easier to narrow your view by region rather than by “issue”. 

What habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity are occurring in your local area? What sources of pollution are in your local area? What local resources are being destroyed? What systems link your local area to destruction happening in other places? How can ecosystems, biodiversity, resilience and sustainability be created? What actively good things can be done in your local area? How can you feed and house people and so on?

Your locality is where you have the strongest ability to take action.

comment,nftttmp,t3_1norwp9,New study predicts areas set to experience extreme water scarcity in the coming decades,"#Running dry: New study warns of extreme water scarcity in the coming decades

by Institute for Basic Science

A new study published in the journal Nature Communications by researchers from the IBS Center for Climate Physics (ICCP) at Pusan National University in the Republic of Korea reveals that global warming is accelerating the risk of multi-year droughts that can lead to extreme water scarcity, threatening water demands in cities, agriculture, and livelihoods worldwide, already within the coming decades.

The study uses the latest generation of climate model simulations to determine the time when local water demands will exceed the regional water supply from precipitation, rivers, and reservoirs. This time is commonly referred to as the Day Zero Drought (DZD). Cities, such as Cape Town (South Africa) in 2018 and Chennai (India) in 2019, have already been close to DZD conditions, highlighting the growing vulnerability of urban water supply systems for drinking water and agriculture.

Understanding where and when these conditions will emerge is crucial for developing effective water management strategies for rural and urban communities. The new study shows that the frequency of DZDs will increase sharply over the coming decades, much sooner than previously anticipated.

The climate models used by the authors were forced with the SSP3-7.0 and SSP2-4.5 greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Focusing on hydrological compound extremes, including prolonged rainfall deficits, reduced river flow, and increasing water consumption, but excluding groundwater reservoirs, the study identifies robust DZD hotspots across the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and parts of North America. Urban areas are particularly vulnerable.

According to the simulations, DZDs are likely to emerge in 35% of the vulnerable regions already within the next 15 years. By the end of this century, DZD conditions could threaten about 750 million people globally, including 470 million city residents and 290 million people in rural areas. The Mediterranean region is projected to have the highest urban exposure, whereas Northern and Southern Africa and parts of Asia face the most severe rural impacts.


""Our study shows that global warming causes and accelerates Day Zero Drought conditions worldwide. Even if we meet the 1.5°C target, hundreds of millions of people will still face unprecedented water shortages,"" says Ph.D. candidate Ravinandrasana, first author of the study.

""According to our calculations, and due to the increasing severity of hydrological stress, 14% of major water reservoirs could dry out already during their first DZD events, with severe impacts on people's livelihoods,"" says corresponding author Prof. Christian Franzke from the IBS Center for Climate Physics.

""Day Zero Droughts are no longer a distant scenario: they are already happening. Without immediate adaptation and sustainable water management, hundreds of millions of people are likely to face unprecedented future water shortages,"" says Ravinandrasana.

How bad is it?,"I work at an Agriculture R&D facility in an agriculture industry heavy area and we're coming off an unprecedented summerlong drought combined with a heatwave that has decimated the area's food production.   This is happening in countless agricultural areas across the planet.  More of this will disrupt food supply raising food prices even further.  My own opinion but I believe some of food inflation is a result of this.

One of the biggest challenges being that mitigation is nearly impossible because of the erratic nature of the events.  In February of 2023 we experienced a polar vortex phenomenon where temperatures plunged to -25c with a further windchill feeling like -48c.  This was catastrophic for wine and stone fruit. Destroyed the season.  In the summer of 2023 we experienced historical rainfall for the entirety of July.  25 of 30 days it rained and in many cases over 100mm withing a few hours which both caused flooding and destroyed the season's berry crops.  The flooding washed out roads to the point where travel during the rain became dangerous and unpredictable.  You can't prepare for every single eventuality. In the arms race of food security vs the climate we are losing and by 2050 the casualties will start piling up.",Zero_Travity,207,1758660737,23-09-2025 20:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1norf6y/suppose_its_2050_and_very_little_has_been_done/nfu2yhl/

How bad is it?,"Even if we stopped all fossil fuel use tomorrow globally, it might not be enough to avoid the climate catastrophies coming. Think about a heavy ship in the ocean heading toward an iceberg. Even if you cut the engines or put the engines in reverse, the inertia of the ship might make a collision unavoidable. The inertia of the global climate is vastly more difficult to change or arrest over short time scales (like a decade), and there are many systems that are self-reinforcing: for example, global warming reduces glacial albedo which increases global warming which creates more water vapor in the atmosphere which increases global warming, etc. Maybe we could reduce the impact of colliding into the iceberg, but the collision will still happen, and it might result in little to no survivors. I consider this to be a realistic (as opposed to pessimistic) scenario, but in my opinion, if we want any hope of avoiding the collision, we need to convince as many people as possible that human civilization depends on all of us working together to try to avoid it. People need to believe that the future of humanity is at stake.

The El Niño-Southern Oscillation cycle causes temporary surges and temporary declines in global temperature.  **When you factor in another 25 years of global warming**, at the current pace...

At some point in the 2050s there will be a moderate to strong El Nino.  This is the point at which the combination of global warming combined with a sudden spike in temperatures (El Nino) causes **agriculture in the hottest regions of the world SEEMS TO ""suddenly"" break.**  

The hottest regions of the world with significant populations are largely in SE Asia.  There's numerous examples in SE Asia that have altitude that won't be as affected (mountainous regions), but I'm talking about the bulk of their population.

It becomes too hot to work outside there, and harvesting / planting becomes impossible.

So many problems occur with various types of agricultural commodities, but many of them start to fail in their own way.

Crops wilt at scale, because the hotter it is, the more rapidly water evaporates from the crops themselves, from irrigated soils, from soils that received rain, and from reservoirs / bodies of water / rivers / et cetera.  Fresh water becomes a serious problem in this environment due to hastened evaporation AND increased freshwater demand by agriculture.  There may be more precipitation globally, but rainfall patterns are expected to change significantly (they already are. *see: ""rainfall patterns during the harvest season in the US wheat producing regions""*), meaning ""the rain won't be falling where we built reservoirs to catch it.""

All these factors combine to mean ""*there's that term that gets brought up at the annual meeting hosted by the World Economic Forum at Devos every other year"":*  Simultaneous crop failures.

This is actually what leaders around the world are wringing their hands over, and they're all in agreement.  The risk of simultaneous crop failures.  Western leaders thought we had insulated the world against famine with a tightly knit system of global trade.  The idea was that if one area got hit hard by a sudden change in weather, *other areas would be able to trade with them*, because someone will do better to make up the difference.

**But that's actually not the likely scenario.**  The likely scenario is that global temperatures steadily increase over a 10-year average timespan... but within 10 year timespans, there are ""peaks and valleys"" in global temperate.  Kind of how like the stock market always grows over the long term, but there are boom and bust cycles.  That's actually how global temperatures operate.

This means that we're likely to stumble into a situation in the 2050s where we have several El Nino years (which are colder), and then suddenly global temperatures spike during the next El Nino *and that is what throughs a significant portion of the global agricultural system over the edge.*

No leader wants to talk to the public about all the nuclear armed nations that fit the bill of being in SE Asia / ""The Middle East"" (really part of Asia or whatever) that are likely to be suddenly pushed over the edge and have their agriculture take a a dump... during an El Nino in the 2050s...  all roughly at the same time.

Having said that, we can extrapolate what we do know now into the future and BAU models suggest mid-century collapse of multiple systems. 

Like others have said, societal collapse could be good for slowing climate change but will likely be disastrous for humans. 

So my advice is expect the worst and build responses that mitigate the damage.

comment,nfwfoc7,t3_1norf6y,Suppose it’s 2050 and very little has been done about climate change. How bad is it?,"This planet’s capacity for sustaining life is already shrinking. There are growing places on Earth right now where life is no longer possible. Islands that are disappearing. Areas in countries like India where humans have lived for thousands of years that are now too dry and too hot for any life, not just human life, to survive.

Crop yields are shrinking for a variety of climate-related reasons. Many countries, including Western countries, are no longer able to keep up with producing enough drinking water. A domino effect has started where melting arctic ice and permafrost are releasing enormous amounts of greenhouse gases that speed up the process. As the oceans warm up and the current change, we’re approaching a tipping point where its no longer individual species that struggle but, once those tipping points are reached, entire ecosystems will simply vanish almost overnight as environmental conditions pass from ‘difficult to livable’ to ‘unlivable’.

A lot of scientists in climate-related fields have quietly shifted from “we must do everything we can” to “if you have the option, move away from major population centres” and “spend your time with your loved ones”. We’re perfectly capable of making big, helpful changes, but we absolutely refuse. Organisations like the UN have already started considering the full collapse of civilisation as we know it to be a potential outcome if no change is made. And we are not making any meaningful change.

My biggest fear from a human perspective is the mass migration of climate refugees. Our Western nations are creaking at the seams over the economic and cultural pressure of hundreds of thousands of refugees. Soon it will be millions, and I wouldn’t be surprised at hundreds of millions of climate refugees. I fully expect one of two outcomes. We resort to genocide to avoid being overrun by a tide of human locusts so unsustainable that it’ll collapse civilization as we know it. Or we waffle too long, and we fail to avoid being overrun by an unsustainable flood of people. 

We love that edgy little maxim, ‘eat the rich,’ but few people consider that to the majority of the human race, we are the rich. Not just the billionaires, but the middle and lower classes too. We don’t have the housing, the infrastructure, the food production, the healthcare, the law enforcement or anything else we need to take on more refugees than we currently have citizens. Genocide or the end of civilization is a dreadful prospect. We’ve proven far too selfish and shortsighted to invest in solutions that would prevent such a mass migration.",Prestigious_Leg2229,1,1758692102,24-09-2025 05:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1norf6y/suppose_its_2050_and_very_little_has_been_done/nfwfoc7/

How bad is it?,"Basically all the discussed metrics are wildly understated, this is something that hundreds of scientists have signed off as supporting. We have dozens upon dozens of overlapping feedback effects, with no upper limits. That should be all the words you need.

For some more detail though, within 15 years Antarctica will be completely gone. By 2050, the city I live in is projected to spend 1/3 of the year flooded, 1/3 of the year in drought, and 1/3 of the year with heatwaves.

2026 we will have the collapse of global supply, and the balkanisation of countries in the years to follow. International trade will never return to the same levels unless we find a way to make transport ships run on biofuel at scale.

Shortly after houses will stop being insurable, which will cause banks to be unable to verify securities and will collapse the global banking system. We will likely see power and land grabs all over the world. I doubt many wars will be able to sustain themselves very long however, as the largest empires will be the most sensitive to supply shocks - where a supply shock to one can critically interrupt the supply chains of others for weeks at a time.

Sea levels will rise, most major coastal cities will be completely reshaped and billions will be forced to migrate inland.

The age of global super structures, predictability and metrics will be long gone. Global fascist movements will attempt to seize control and will eventually fail - the world's populations are too educated and mobilised now to roll over, and the internal contradictions of fascism to great for it survive severe supply disruptions.

In the longer term, as large empires become untenable as everybody scrambles to deal with the problems in their own backyard, likely we will see society start to naturally follow a progression that resembles the collapse of the bronze era, rome etc - where \~80% of the population over time move away from city centers, and widely dispersed city states, collectives and villages become the norm.",rzm25,1,1758783823,25-09-2025 07:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1norf6y/suppose_its_2050_and_very_little_has_been_done/ng34wte/

But seriously . As with most things I think it will be somewhat less dramatic and more mundane than the doom laden predictions,  as with the other things people go on about.

It will continue to warm for sure . But the millions of refugees, East Anglia being underwater and ice free summers in the Arctic ? All longstanding 2050 predictions. 

I cannot help but think that if these things were going to happen by 2050 we would be closer to them now than we are today. I also think there are a few things naturally happening that will stack in our favour even with little to no active actions

Population levelling off - in many developed countries birth rates are not even at replacement levels . In due course this could well end up being replicated in the developing world. Its kind of a bit sad in a way as some of it is down to people being unable to fulfil their life goals for various reasons, but nonetheless a stable population beats an exploding one for pollution including CO2 emissions

Peak car - this is definitely a thing in the UK already, young people aren't learning to drive as much and once the ICE car ban comes in I think this will be a watershed moment . We will see mass car ownership become a thing of the past and if will be replaced by cars as a service /public transport alternatives which will fill the gap and be much more efficient and less polluting . This will initially be the UK and Europe but will quickly spread to other countries

16.1 Glacial Periods in Earth's History – Physical Geology
Yes, an interglacial period is a warmer, short-term period of a long, cold ice age; the current interglacial is the Holocene, part of the much longer Quaternary ice age. Earth's geological record shows cycles of cold glacial periods with advancing ice sheets and warmer interglacial periods with retreating ice sheets, all of which occur within the overall framework of an ice age.  
Understanding the Terms 
Ice Age: A very long geological interval, lasting millions of years, when global temperatures are colder and large areas of the Earth are covered by continental ice sheets.
Glacial Period: A colder, shorter-term phase within an ice age when ice sheets and glaciers advance.
Interglacial Period: A warmer, shorter-term phase within an ice age when glaciers retreat.
The Current Situation
We are currently living in the Holocene interglacial, which began about 11,000 to 12,000 years ago. 
This interglacial period is part of the ongoing Quaternary ice age, which started approximately 2.6 million years ago. 
Why We're Still in an Ice Age 
Even though our current period is relatively warm compared to glacial periods, the Earth's continental ice sheets still exist.
An ice age is defined by the presence of these vast ice sheets, not by a complete lack of them.",DBCooper211,-2,1758659850,23-09-2025 20:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1norf6y/suppose_its_2050_and_very_little_has_been_done/nftzqr0/

'We project that adaptation and income growth alleviate 23% of global losses in 2050 and 34% at the end of the century (6% and 12%, respectively; moderate-emissions scenario), *but substantial residual losses remain for all staples except rice*. In contrast to analyses of other outcomes that project the greatest damages to the global poor10,11, we find that global impacts are dominated by losses to modern-day breadbaskets with favourable climates and limited present adaptation, although losses in low-income regions losses are also substantial. These results indicate a scale of innovation, cropland expansion or further adaptation that might be necessary to ensure food security in a changing climate.'

That paper focuses exclusively on Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude regions while ignoring major Southern Hemisphere producers (Australia, Argentina, Brazil) that operate on different seasonal cycles and weather systems.

Northern Hemisphere jet stream patterns have minimal influence on Southern Hemisphere agriculture, which undermines the paper's premise about global synchronized failures.

Brazil has become an agricultural superpower with record exports ($164B in 2024) and production (322M tons of grain expected in 2024-25), fundamentally altering global food security dynamics since the paper's analysis period. Australia is the 4th largest wheat producer in the world.

Lastly the risk of synchronised low yields is increased by only a tiny amount (2% or some such).",Economy-Fee5830,1,1758676003,24-09-2025 01:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1norf6y/suppose_its_2050_and_very_little_has_been_done/nfvcs9j/

Tornado alley knows how to deal with tornados, how to build for them, how to shelter for them.  That's the reason people can live there, there's infrastructure in place that has been built and tested for the past 2 centuries. The flooding here in Appalachia is a precursor and it knocked us back to the stone age for months. Thousands of people died. The first one hit 2 years ago and there are still people living in campers, still places without water. 


I think that deserves more than one sentence worth of coverage, especially with FEMA operating on a shoestring.

comment,nfybzou,t1_nfxjg36,Suppose it’s 2050 and very little has been done about climate change. How bad is it?,"Here's what the science says:

>**Droughts**

>Different drought types exist, and they are associated with different impacts and respond differently to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Precipitation deficits and changes in evapotranspiration govern net water availability. A lack of sufficient soil moisture, sometimes amplified by increased atmospheric evaporative demand, results in agricultural and ecological drought. Lack of runoff and surface water result in hydrological drought. {11.6}

>Human-induced climate change has contributed to increases in agricultural andecological droughts in some regions due to evapotranspiration increases (**medium confidence**). Increases in evapotranspiration have been driven by increases in atmospheric evaporative demand induced by increased temperature, decreased relative humidity and increased net radiation (**high confidence**). Trends in precipitation are not a main driver in affecting global-scale trends in drought (medium confidence), but have induced increases in meteorological droughts in a few AR6 regions (NES: **high confidence**; WAF, CAF, ESAF, SAM, SWS, SSA, SAS: **medium confidence**). Increasing trends in agricultural and ecological droughts have been observed on all continents (WAF, CAF, WSAF, ESAF, WCA, ECA, EAS, SAU, MED, WCE, WNA, NES: **medium confidence**), but decreases only in one AR6 region (NAU: **medium confidence**). Increasing trends in hydrological droughts have been observed in a few AR6 regions (MED: **high confidence**; WAF, EAS, SAU: **medium confidence**). Regional-scale attribution shows that human-induced climate change has contributed to increased agricultural and ecological droughts (MED, WNA), and increased hydrological drought (MED) in some regions (**medium confidence**). {11.6, 11.9}

>More regions are affected by increases in agricultural and ecological droughts with increasing global warming (**high confidence**). Several regions will be affected by more severe agricultural and ecological droughts even if global warming is stabilised at 2°C, including MED, WSAF, SAM and SSA (**high confidence**), and ESAF, MDG, EAU, SAU, SCA, CAR, NSA, NES, SWS, WCE, NCA, WNA and CNA (**medium confidence**). Some regions are also projected to be affected by more severe agricultural and ecological droughts at 1.5°C (MED, WSAF, ESAF, SAU, NSA, SAM, SSA, CNA, **medium confidence**). At 4°C of global warming, about 50% of all inhabited AR6 regions would be affected by increases in agricultural and ecological droughts (WCE, MED, CAU, EAU, SAU, WCA, EAS, SCA, CAR, NSA, NES, SAM, SWS, SSA, NCA, CNA, ENA, WNA, WSAF, ESAF, MDG: **medium confidence or higher**), and only two regions (NEAF, SAS) would experience decreases in agricultural and ecological drought (**medium confidence**). There is **high confidence** that the projected increases in agricultural and ecological droughts are strongly affected by evapotranspiration increases associated with enhanced atmospheric evaporative demand. Several regions are projected to be more strongly affected by hydrological droughts with increasing global warming (at 4°C of global warming: NEU, WCE, EEU, MED, SAU, WCA, SCA, NSA, SAM, SWS, SSA, WNA, WSAF, ESAF, MDG: medium confidence or higher). There is low confidence that effects of enhanced atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations on plant water-use efficiency alleviate extreme agricultural and ecological droughts in conditions characterized by limited soil moisture and enhanced atmospheric evaporative demand. There is also low confidence that these effects will substantially reduce global plant transpiration and the severity of hydrological droughts. There is **high confidence** that the land carbon sink will become less efficient due to soil moisture limitations and associated drought conditions in some regions in higher-emissions scenarios, in particular under global warming levels above 4°C. {11.6, 11.9, Cross-Chapter Box 5.1}

>**Compound Events, Including Dry/Hot Events, Fire Weather, Compound Flooding, and Concurrent Extremes** 

>The probability of compound events has likely increased in the past due to human-induced climate change and will likely continue to increase with further global warming. Concurrent heatwaves and droughts have become more frequent, and this trend will continue with higher global warming (**high confidence**). Fire weather conditions (compound hot, dry and windy events) have become more probable in some regions (**medium confidence**) and there is **high confidence** that they will become more frequent in some regions at higher levels of global warming. The probability of compound flooding (storm surge, extreme rainfall and/or river flow) has increased in some locations (**medium confidence**), and will continue to increase due to sea level rise and increases in heavy precipitation, including changes in precipitation intensity associated with tropical cyclones (**high confidence**). The land area affected by concurrent extremes has increased (**high confidence**). Concurrent extreme events at different locations, but possibly affecting similar sectors (e.g., critical crop-producing areas for global food supply) in different regions, will become more frequent with increasing global warming, in particular above 2°C of global warming (**high confidence**). {11.8, Box 11.2, Box 11.4}.

Some regions have been devastated by singular events like being hit by a hurricane, tsunami or extremely rapid weather changes - what happens when a nation gets hit by all 3 in the space of 5 years? It's flattened beyond the point of repair. 

Imagine the US being hit by 2 large scale hurricanes in the same year, extreme flooding somewhere else 6 months later and a third of the countries crops fail due to heat/cold or blight the following year?

comment,nfu52bb,t1_nftwvse,Suppose it’s 2050 and very little has been done about climate change. How bad is it?,"Maybe not organizations, but I can think of several credentialed and legitimate scientists, including climate scientists, who while they don’t suggest that dire scenario as _certain,_ do say stuff like that is possible as a result of civilizational collapse, coming from things like widespread crop failures causing food supply chains to collapse. 

A NASA scientist (geologist/climatologist and astrobiologist) that worked on the current Mars Rover (I think that’s Curiosity), who I worked with for about a year on a climate sustainability involved app definitely thought stuff like this was possible, _in the worst case scenarios,_ within a few decades or more like a half century out. 

The situation is actually pretty dire and very serious either way: we hit 1.5 C of warming _a lot_ faster than most predicted, and it could potentially be greatly accelerating due to an unforeseen feedback loop that we’ve already hit that’s just coming into effect now, and when the trapped methane gets released: that could be _very_ bad. Methane traps heat on Earth _four times_ more efficiently than CO2 and there’s an absolutely disastrous amount of it under permafrost, that will start releasing with not too much more warming. 

The point isn’t to scaremonger or be fatalistic, but realistic about the fact that worst case scenarios are still possible, so we should do whatever we can to mitigate those possibilities. OP asked what the result would be if we _did nothing_ from here onward, and that’s just not going to happen (outside America, anyway, and probably inside it too via private industry at least until Trump/GOP control ends).",hypermodernvoid,14,1758661340,23-09-2025 21:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1norf6y/suppose_its_2050_and_very_little_has_been_done/nfu52bb/

There's certainty around global mean temperatures continuing to rise under all scenarios, heat extremes continuing their upward trajectory, and continued rise of water levels and coastal flooding.  How severe the damage will be or if there will be any increase in extreme weather events is much lower confidence and up for debate.

Add on top of that the fact that any doomsday scenarios that were predicted 40-50 years ago have been completely inaccurate, and the fact that the models themselves are flawed to the point of being comical, and its simple fact to say that anyone who thinks they know what 2050 will look like is guessing.",spider1258,0,1758661103,23-09-2025 20:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1norf6y/suppose_its_2050_and_very_little_has_been_done/nfu48x2/

This isn't happening. Nearly all of the migration up North is pretty traditional economic migration.

How bad is it?,"That’s not how it works though, the net “loss” of calories is only when we feed straight grains and oil seeds which in beef is on the finishing side or in dairy a portion of the ration. In the case of ruminants they are breaking down fibers that we (humans) cannot process efficiently and converting them into protein and fat. We cannot eat grasses, which is what ruminants can process and eat. 

Now conventional swine production you could make an argument is a net waste but pigs have a more efficient feed/gain ratio. Realistically if you wanted to maximize efficiency we should go back to everyone having a hog and feeding them scraps. 

Poultry is so efficient on feed/grain that I would be surprised if anyone really wants to argue with its production.",Iam_Thundercat,1,1758746702,24-09-2025 20:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1norf6y/suppose_its_2050_and_very_little_has_been_done/ng0i07i/

CONSERVATIVES were always Truth-agnostic, simple scheme:

1) Appeal to the dumbest, use any lie they want to hear (plus, recently, even invent NEW LIES that might work with the simple-minded). The resulting programme is totally illogical politics; that doesn't matter because:

2) After the election, instead do what the 0.1% demand, your corruptors. In turn, the life of the simpler people gets even worse, so for next election ... GOTO (1)

The same scheme doesn't work with cleverer voters.

Democracy is broken, because the dumbest and least educated are allowed to vote (Greek democracy was different BTW) ... AND conservatives are allowed to lie to them without ANY consequences. [The latter can be changed more easily.]

The anti-scientific strategy of the CONSERVATIVES (who actually understand science partially, but simply lie about it, to catch ALL the dumbest voters) is a strong fix point in their DEMOCRACY DICHOTOMISATION, clever versus dumb. For them it works VERY well.

(And the whole planet is in danger. Remember the UN having to listen to that incoherent brainworm diarrhea, with fictional facts that will kill billions(!); yes Hitler seemingly was only a local anomaly, compared to the global Antihuman.)

- those are ideal numbers, and don't account for fluctuations involved in actual farming. If you try to grow exactly as much food as you need, one bad harvest will kill you

- 185 people isn't enough to guard 500 acres let alone the people they're meant to be guarding, and that's if non-guards take up specialised roles (absolutely necessary, and none of them require skills that transfer feom finance)

- billions of dollars build the infrastructure, but once supply chains breakdown, you're working with limited resources. Does your acreage include an iron mine? A coal mine? A steel refinery? How are you gonna get the nitrogen for the fertiliser? Once your solar panels and batteries need maintenance, are you going to extract rare earth minerals yourself?

- if you plan on expanding outside your walls and growing food there, you need even more resources to face the masses who will also want that food

Going from ~200 people to 'thousands' is pure fantasy. The only reason you're alive right now is relative social stability. Aspen is going to be one of the most dangerous places in the world, you're looking at millions of American climate migrants, and they'll be armed to the teeth.

The majority of India's rice is now under irrigation - India now feels their crops are monsoon proof, but I am not surprised you dont know that lol.

comment,ng194zm,t1_nfvdsfn,Suppose it’s 2050 and very little has been done about climate change. How bad is it?,"""...rice is one of those crops which benefits from climate change"" - no it isn't. Where do you get this stuff? 

Sure, it likes more CO2 but...

\#1. Rice is extremely sensitive to high temperatures, especially during flowering. Just a few hot days above \~35 °C at the wrong time can sharply reduce yields.

\#2. Rice is water-intensive. In South and Southeast Asia, climate change is already making monsoon rains less predictable and depleting groundwater, leading to deeper and deeper rural wells (India and Bangladesh are prime examples). This increases irrigation costs and vulnerability to drought.

\#3. Sea-level rise threatens rice paddies in low-lying deltas (Ganges–Brahmaputra, Mekong, Nile). More frequent floods and saltwater intrusion damage crops.

\#4. Warmer, wetter conditions expand the range of insects, weeds, and pathogens harmful to rice.

\#5. Rice in India is not (yet) becoming “monsoon-proof” in any robust or comprehensive sense. Researchers assess that rice still remains highly vulnerable to monsoon variability (timing, distribution, intensity) and to extreme events like droughts, floods, and heat spells.

India’s water situation is considered one of the most volatile in the world, and the Himalayan glacier retreat adds an additional layer of uncertainty.

Wells in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and parts of peninsular India have gone from shallow hand-pumps to borewells hundreds of meters deep. Recharge is not keeping pace.

All major rivers (Ganga, Indus, Brahmaputra, Godavari, Krishna, Cauvery) are over-allocated. Industrial, urban, and agricultural demand are competing, leading to frequent inter-state conflicts (e.g. Cauvery, Krishna disputes).

The NITI Aayog “Composite Water Management Index” warned that **21 Indian cities could run out of groundwater** by the early 2030s.

There's a ton more on this, but clearly you are not well informed on this topic.

**Long-term/global picture**: Negative overall. Heat, erratic water supply, sea-level rise, and disease pressures outweigh the CO₂ fertilization benefit. This is especially critical in Asia, where rice is the staple for billions.",clickster,1,1758755574,24-09-2025 23:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1norf6y/suppose_its_2050_and_very_little_has_been_done/ng194zm/

A 30% loss under the Current Policies by 2100 scenario should be compared with a baseline that assumes no climate change. Under the baseline, the GDP is
expected to grow substantially by the end of the century, so even with climate change damages standing at 30%, global GDP would still grow by more than 150%
in the Current Policies scenario by 2100 compared to today (while it would grow by 215% without climate change).

> Using a logistic loss function implies significant economic loss
occurs at 2˚C of warming, then between 2˚C and 3˚C, although
there is significant variation depending on the assumptions
used. With the 6˚C ruin parameterisation around 30% GDP loss
occurs at 3˚C of warming compared with 80% GDP loss using
the 4˚C ruin parameterisation. Taking this approach would
drive more realistic TCFD results than the benign hot-house

valuable in terms of considering the possible implications of
adverse scenarios.

The study you referenced admits ""future yield estimates remain uncertain"". Why might that be?Regional water availability is highly variable. Forcings incorporated in the models lean toward more optimistic scenarios. Worst case models are framed as highly unlikely.   
  
In fact, we are currently tracking toward these less favourable scenarios, with a growing number of increasing headwinds further accelerating this trajectory in recent years.

Global averages also obscure regional vulnerabilities. At around 25% of global rice production, we should be interested as to why regional projections diverge sharply from the global picture. High emission pathways explored in India's National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) data projected up to a 10% fall in rice yield.

I would argue these are way too optimistic, since India's rice belts are already near thermal thresholds.

Just the risk that we could be should require much more serious concern than is frequently seen.

In their tail-risk scenarios, such as the reverse stress testing in Planetary Solvency (2025), the IFoA projects catastrophic outcomes where global GDP could contract by 50% or more between 2070 and 2090 under a 3-4°C warming pathway.

These scenarios assume cascading impacts like multiple tipping points (e.g., Amazon dieback, permafrost thaw), mass migration, and sociopolitical fragmentation, which could lead to absolute economic collapse in some regions or globally. Here, ""contraction"" implies negative GDP growth, not just slower growth, as entire asset classes become uninsurable and economies face systemic insolvency.

This reply is not for you, but for others reading your dismissive shoot from the hip responses.  
  
It's based on a combination of IPCC assessments, emissions data, and analyses of uncertainties in climate sensitivity and feedbacks, which collectively suggest that remaining carbon budgets for limiting warming are extremely tight or potentially already exceeded.   
  
They reference:  
  
**Carbon Budget Exhaustion for 1.5°C**: They draw on the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6, 2021) and a position paper from the Climate Crisis Advisory Group (CCAG), estimating a remaining global carbon budget of approximately 320 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO₂ from 2022 for a 67% chance of staying below 1.5°C, or 420 Gt for a 50% chance. With annual emissions around 40 Gt CO₂-equivalent, this implies the budget could be depleted in roughly 8-10 years from that baseline.   
  
IFoA makes downward adjustments due to uncertainties: insufficient action on non-CO₂ greenhouse gases (e.g., methane at record highs), triggered tipping points (e.g., permafrost thaw or Amazon dieback releasing stored carbon), and ongoing deforestation reducing natural sinks. These factors could effectively render the 1.5°C budget as already exhausted or negative, making continued emissions incompatible with that limit.  
  
**Potential Breach of 2°C by 2050**: Based on current GHG concentrations,  doubled from pre-industrial.   
  
Under such scenarios, even without further emissions increases, committed warming from existing GHGs could exceed 2°C by mid-century. This aligns with projections where the planet is warming faster than anticipated.  
  
**Uncertainty in Warming Projections**: A core pillar is equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), the long-term warming from doubling CO₂, with IPCC AR6 giving a likely range of 2.5–4°C and a best estimate of 3°C. The IFoA cites analyses (e.g., from Carbon Brief) suggesting some evidence for a higher best estimate around 4°C, driven by uncertainties in aerosol cooling effects, ocean heat uptake, and cloud feedbacks.   
  
There's an 18% probability of ECS exceeding 4.5°C, and Earth-system sensitivity (including slower feedbacks like ice-sheet melt) could be double that of ECS, potentially leading to much higher warming even under moderate emissions scenarios like RCP2.6 to RCP4.5.

As this is a conversation about risk, IFoA's precautionary approach critiques optimistic assumptions in standard models, arguing for ""roughly right"" estimates that incorporate these tail risks to better inform actuarial and financial planning.",clickster,1,1758676142,24-09-2025 01:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1norf6y/suppose_its_2050_and_very_little_has_been_done/nfvd63t/

There is almost no transformation of industrial agriculture occurring, forest clearing accelerated again in '24, global pledged reductions of fossil fuel use are way too small and slow to avert various tipping points --- this is just a fantasy time line.

\> double counting uncertainty

No, see point 1.

\> **they assume everyone died at 6 degrees**

No, they assume GDP ends at 6 degrees. This is quite generous considering it's quite common to read or hear lower numbers used as the level at which civilisation as we know it would very likely stop  functioning.

I would argue the point of the paper is to start an important conversation. If you don't like their reverse stress test, fine - point me to a better one. Is there a better one?

comment,nftdfrn,t3_1nopvyw,"China expected to announce its 2025 Paris Agreement climate policies tomorrow, could make or break the ""well below 2C target""","#China may strengthen climate role amid US fossil fuel push

All eyes are on China this week, as the world's biggest polluter readies a new emissions-cutting plan—reinforcing its role as a steadfast defender of global climate diplomacy while Europe stalls and the United States doubles down on fossil fuels.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has convened a mini climate summit on Wednesday during a week of high-level talks, where Beijing is expected to unveil its updated ""Nationally Determined Contributions.""

These need to be in place before the main climate gathering of the year, the COP30 summit in Belem, Brazil, in November.

Although China accounts for nearly 30% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions, it has increasingly positioned itself as a driving force in international climate talks and as a green technology superpower.

It has strongly backed the UN process under the Paris Agreement despite the second departure of its principal geopolitical rival, the United States.

""China is a very stable partner,"" Brazil's Ana Toni, CEO of COP30, told AFP. ""We are expecting China to continue on the right path. Let us hope that the other players will do the same.""

Chinese Premier Li Qiang is poised to be the first speaker at the mini summit and could unveil the new plan then, or it may come before.

What China chooses as its 2035 emissions reduction target could make or break the Paris goal of limiting warming to ""well below"" 2C since preindustrial times and preferably 1.5C—a target Guterres told AFP last week could be at risk of ""collapsing.""

Beijing has said its 2035 plan will, for the first time, cover all economic sectors and greenhouse gases.


##Under promise, over deliver
Under its last plan, announced in 2021, China said it would aim to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve net zero by 2060—deemed highly insufficient by groups that track such targets.

But observers say it is more important to watch what China does than what it says.

""The China approach is 'We'll set a modest target then outperform it,'"" Helen Clarkson, CEO of the international nonprofit Climate Group that runs Climate Week in New York City every September told AFP.

By contrast, the European Union failed to adopt a unified plan ahead of the UN General Assembly, opting for a non-binding statement of intent—although the 27-nation bloc has decarbonized faster than many other developed nations.

And the United States under President Donald Trump has recast itself as a zealous promoter of fossil fuels.

During his first term, the US withdrew from the Paris accord.

In his second term, Washington has not simply abandoned climate action but has gone on the offensive for oil and gas interests—threatening to punish countries that participate in the International Maritime Organization's carbon pricing system for shipping and embedding the sale of US liquefied natural gas (LNG) in trade deals, for example.

""Countries are confronted with competing sales pitches, as China tries to sell them solar panels and the US pushes LNG,"" Manish Bapna, president of the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, told AFP.

""For China, it's a long-term economic plan, and of course, they can do that because of the structure of their politics,"" said Clarkson. ""What we haven't really figured out is how to do these long-term climate plans on short-term democratic cycles.""",Economy-Fee5830,16,1758653497,23-09-2025 18:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nopvyw/china_expected_to_announce_its_2025_paris/nftdfrn/

The US and the Western Powers have orchestrated a global system of trade and finance centered around fossil fuel.   China wants to shift the venter of gravity of global trade to themselves, and they have the capability to replace quite a bit of the demand for fossil fuels.  Renewable energy assets are durable, so nations who buy them won't depend on China quite the same way fossil fuel importers depend on producers, financiers, and the US Navy keeping shipping lanes open.    But in this particular completion, they gain relative to the US by making other nations like Pakistan more independent.

The table is based on what I call ""formal centennial climate"".  It predicts for each year in the first row, how many degrees C global climate will be above preindustrial.  The predictions are based on just three time series limited to data between 1850 and the year in the first column.  The three series are global HadCRUT5; CO2 from Antarctic ice cores up to 1958 and Mauna Loa thereafter; and TSI, total solar irradiance, as reconstructed independently by UC Boulder's Greg Kopp and Stanford's Leif Svalgaard.  Ocean and solar oscillations with periods 65 years and shorter are removed with a trapezoidal filter, which removes the shorter periods better than a traditional box filter.  Using multiple linear regression, the CO2 and TSI data are fitted to HadCRUT5, resulting in respective coefficients R\_g (greenhouse) and R\_s (solar).  Goodness of fit is estimated with the standard deviation (square root of unexplained variance) σ mK.  If simple linear regression is used based only on CO2, the fit is worse as indicated by σ', as a result of incorrectly attributing rising insolation in the first half of the 20th century to CO2.  R\_g amounts to transient climate response in degrees per doubling of CO2 after taking insolation into account.  R\_s is solar response in degrees per W/m2 of TSI.  ""Preindustrial"" is defined as climate during the millennium 500-1500 CE in order to avoid the artificially cold Little Ice Age of 1600-1800.

According to the table, we are currently about one decade from the 2015 Paris Accord's guard rail of 1.5 ℃ and about three decades from 2.0 ℃.

There is no universally agreed-on definition of climate.  The above is merely mine; its advantage over more traditional definitions such as the WMO's is that you don't have to wait 15 years before being sure you've hit the guard rail.  With my definition, thanks to its relative stability as more data comes to hand, you can see it coming decades in advance.  If you have a better definition I'm all ears.",Pale_Fly_5534,1,1759171767,29-09-2025 18:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nopvyw/china_expected_to_announce_its_2025_paris/ngvieaa/

post,1nog5cp,,How to deal with a parent who denies climate change?,"I’ve been trying to tell her it’s completely real and she needs to stop believing what the government tells her.
I’ve sent multiple photos and articles of evidence: Examples being the hurricanes rapidly strengthening due to rising ocean heat.
Ice caps melting in a span of a decade. The coral reefs dying.

I even sent her evidence that most countries and people believe in it. But she claims it’s “leftists propaganda”. She says as a scientist that the information is false. (She’s a nurse)
How do I even deal with this? To be honest, I was thinking of just not dealing with her weird opinions at all. You can’t make dumb realize they’re dumb. ",SickMeter,73,1758630832,23-09-2025 12:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nog5cp/how_to_deal_with_a_parent_who_denies_climate/

comment,nfrgon9,t3_1nog5cp,How to deal with a parent who denies climate change?,"Most likely there is some conservative value that they think accepting climate change would challenge. So it's easier to deny the problem exists, than accept your core political value is wrong.


A common one is anti globalism.


Much of the climate movement assumes a paradigm of global trust and cooperation. We reduce emissions which builds trust with other countries who then also reduce emissions. This leads to benefit for all countries. 


But isolationists don't trust other countries to play fair. So in their minds domestic climate action doesn't lead to other countries reducing emissions. Hence domestic action has a cost greater than benefit. 


But there are other approaches to climate change that don't require a global cooperation lens. 


Which is key because you MUST NOT challenge their core political identify if you want to get them on board. You must use their values constructively.


For the anti globalist you can focus on the problem of foreign emissions. Paint this as an external threat that can cause great harm to your country. Which is completely true. 


If your country took a harsh response to the harm of foreign emissions, that would act as a disincentive for other countries emissions. Which is a good thing. 


(Other countries will hold your country to account too, but probably don't mention that part unless they bring it up) 


This is a climate policy that can resonate with isolationists. But will likely make the globalists here uncomfortable.


Your parent might have a different key issue to globalism. Perhaps socialism or something based on what you've mentioned. 


You need to spin the problem and solution in a way that is compatible with those particular key political views


The key thing is this less about facts and more about values and identify. Unless their identity is related to science or knowledge focus primarily on values not facts.",Joshau-k,19,1758633526,23-09-2025 13:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nog5cp/how_to_deal_with_a_parent_who_denies_climate/nfrgon9/

My personal guess is that people who are conservative in their values are more rigid in their ways, and either don’t want to confront an inconvenient truth, or are influenced by perhaps a religious need to believe that the world was perfectly made for us and it will always be that way. And any suggestion that the world is in flux or imperfect suggests that god messed up or isn’t in control, etc.

The key is to get people to acknowledge the concept that gasses can affect temperature, because that's the central disconnect. This is difficult for some people because it's not really observable in their daily lives. You have to boil it down to something that is *observable,* *simple and non-controversial*. 

This may not work with your mom, but I've found something that helps to get the gears turning is to pose this simple question: ""why do you think that Venus is hotter than Mercury even though it's further from the sun.""

Why do you want her to believe in it? Do you think that she can change it? Do you think that if you just convince her about this one issue that she's going to leave those old beliefs behind and start voting in a way that is more helpful? Does it bother you that she is willingly voting and believing in such a way that is so contrary to what you need to feel safe and secure in the new world?

Your mom can't fix the fear you have surrounding climate change. Her one vote isn't enough to change the world, or even to stop the dominoes that are falling. She can't comfort you. She can't make this better. She's just a person. 

Don't get me wrong, I struggled with this too. I had to do the work to accept that this is one of those times where I have to be a big girl and do better on my own. My parents aren't going to fix this existentially scary threat, and even if they wanted too, they can't. It's painful, because your mind wants to make it a referendum on their love for you, but it isn't. Two things can be true. She loves you. She is woefully misguided on climate change.

comment,nftyk0r,t3_1nog5cp,How to deal with a parent who denies climate change?,"I like the suggestion to ask her what evidence would change her mind.

In relation to evidence. The below is information which is generally not put forward to discuss and support the evidence for climate change. It could be worth mentioning - as it sits in a different area to a lot of climate change research and discussion. The information is commercial, and used to make a profit. I feel coming at it from this perspective makes the issues more relatable and applicable to people’s individual circumstances. They can look up this data, and see how their house or suburb sits in it.

15 years ago I worked for the Government. Our Department invited the CEO of an Insurance Company in to speak with us at a Seminar. He told us about the ‘unseasonal weather events’ which would become more and more common throughout the world due to climate change. 

These will impact crops (food), transportation and logistical (supply chains), cost of living (food, fuel, medicine, shelter, education). 

The bottom line was things will cost more, and be more uncertain due to floods, unseasonal storms, frosts, rain, heat, wind, fire and so on.

Insurer’s need this information to calculate their premiums and make a profit. Many houses and locations won’t be insurable in the future. 

Insurance Companies aren’t making this up. Their business agenda is to supply a product which assists people recover after unexpected losses. They need to make accurate forecasts, or they will cease to be profitable and stay open.  Insurers have the best and most talented mathematicians and statistics experts working on their risk analysis tables, calculations and forecasts. These risk assessments are publicly available, and they will openly discuss them.

Our Department factored higher costs into the above areas in the 10 year budget forecasts.

However, generally Government’s don’t advise the public about what they know. I worked at another Department. They had all of the information about which parts of the country will be affected by sea level rise and when. They knew which suburbs and areas, yet were still building there in some cases and making no attempt to make a start on addressing these issues. The truth is, they can’t. They will be voted out if they tell people. They can’t address and mitigate the hundreds of issues created over time by short term Policy decisions - without the support of the general public, a huge amount of money and an acceptance that the way we live needs to change.

There is no conspiracy with Insurers - they are in the business of making money out of disasters. They provide transparent data. This is a great place to start in providing solid evidence and data. 

Unlike Politicians and Government - who need to say things to keep people happy - to be re-elected. 

Unlike the media - who need to sell news, on a permanent cycle to stay in business - where each source has its own agenda, advertisers to appease and budgets to make.

Unlike Policy Planners - who have their often very good Policy recommendations rejected, as they don’t suit the agenda of Politicians.

Unlike businesses - many of whom often rely on the status quo.

Unlike the wealthy - who figure they can buy a bunker and avoid what’s coming. 

Unlike Fox News - who rely on creating fear in the wrong places, to stop people from seeing the areas they really should be concerned about.",Clear-Board-7940,1,1758659516,23-09-2025 20:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nog5cp/how_to_deal_with_a_parent_who_denies_climate/nftyk0r/

comment,nfxgkdn,t3_1nog5cp,How to deal with a parent who denies climate change?,"I usually find that most people who deny or don't care aren't swayed to do anything by seeing more research. The best methods I have found are either emotional topics or something closer to home. For most in my family that is financial benefits or something that benefits the local environment like stray garbage. independence for other countries can also work depending on where you live and how much your country imports in particular oil and gas.

Though something to also think about is: Who cares if they believe it is real as long as they do something to improve the general situation and their own?  
Honestly when it comes to a lot of climate action... it is just a good idea to do anyway. It simply doesn't matter if climate change is real or not. Burning coal and fossil fuels is like using the air as our sewage system is just not a good idea period. It doesn't matter if it changes the climate or not, we are currently poisoning the air we breathe.

Honestly if a nurse can't believe that breathing in burnt coal is bad for you... well what else can you really say. So if you have to convince her go for a topic closer to home. Ot start with something that you can agree on. Like smoking is bad, thus burning coal for electricity instead of any renewable source is not good for your health.

Couldn't add a picture for some reason but the following cartoon I find rather fitting to your situation. Cause that is pretty much what all climate deniers are yelling about. ""What if it is all a big hoax and we make a better world for nothing?""

comment,ngcws14,t3_1nog5cp,How to deal with a parent who denies climate change?,"Is she denying the climate is changing or denying that humans are the reason? There is a difference!

The scream of ""Climate Change!!!"" that is being broadcast is a political premise, not a scientific one. The science data set is skewed to reinforce the political attribute. That manipulation instills feelings and evades the practices of science. The scientific backup reinforcing the ""Climate Change"" issue should be psychological, not ecological or biological.

Yes the climate is changing. That has always been the case and will continue in perpetuity. Are humans and their behaviors causing it? Scientific facts point to NO. The human effect on the climate changing is very little per lifespan compared to natural effects. Over thousands of years of behaviors, sure, maybe there will be an effect. That rate of change per behavior is negligible.

All of the ""facts"" being stated that supposedly backup the premise of HUMAN AFFECTED climate change are subjective not objective. How do these people know the hurricanes are stronger now than 4,000 years ago? What were the dimensions and characteristics of the ice caps 10,000 years ago? Coral reefs dying, is that a temperature issue or a water quality issue? At what point in the cycle is the Earth currently in so the modeling can be accurate? (Hint: no scientist, even Dr. Malcolm, can answer that last one because there are too many variables, so it's a guess.)

Please be clear when you say Climate Change. Are you being political or scientific. There is a difference. As you say, ""You can’t make dumb realize they’re dumb"".

>Warmer sea surface temperatures intensify tropical storm wind speeds, giving them the potential to deliver more damage if they make landfall. **Over the 39-year period from 1979-2017, the number of major hurricanes has increased** while the number of smaller hurricanes has decreased. Based on modeling, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts an increase in Category 4 and 5 hurricanes, alongside increased hurricane wind speeds. Warmer sea temperatures also cause wetter hurricanes, with 10-15 percent more precipitation from storms projected. Recent storms such as Hurricane Harvey in 2017 (which dropped more than 60 inches in some locations), Florence in 2018 (with over 35 inches) and Imelda in 2019 (44 inches) demonstrate the devastating floods that can be triggered by these high-rain hurricanes.

The IPCC AR6 and recent studies disagree regarding increase in intensity.  Longer-term studies have higher uncertainty because the ability to reliably monitor hurricanes globally has only existed since the satellite era began around 1980. Data from the first half of the 20th century is limited, and records from the 19th century are particularly problematic.  

Small changes to the correction factor for the lack of reliable measurements in earlier periods can cause large changes in calculating trends.

comment,nfx1632,t1_nfvljop,How to deal with a parent who denies climate change?,"Add in the sugar shortage, various oil shortages, and Y2K that was supposed to have planes falling out of the sky - plus the fact that surveys/research are sometimes funded by those seeking results aligned with their claim - and you can see why people don’t listen.  And yes I know sugar and y2k aren’t environment issues - the point is being bombarded with “sky is falling” issues every decade that it’s easy to switch off entirely. 

Then there’s C-19 where in Canada we were forced to stay at home from school and work for over a year, forced to stand in the freezing cold 45 minutes or more to get into a supermarket, forced to get vaccinated and wear masks, all for the reports to come out now saying what many thought all along.  

The global supply chain was impacted, skyrocketing the cost of living for everyone. Climate change initiatives are going to further impact regular folks financially. Who can afford any more fees or suffer any more cutbacks? 

What actual change is being recommending? Ordinary people are given a paper straw or wooden cutlery while the wealthy still travel around on their jets and yachts. Canadians were carbon-taxed by our government (who removed the tax to get elected, then seem to be rebranding it afterward). Yes, many Canadians received rebates to offset what they paid - but not all, and what a waste of finances collecting and refunding it right back. It all sounds like a racket. Why not use the money to plant trees and expand infrastructure to actually make a difference? 

Governments want us to ditch gasoline powered vehicles for electric? Electric batteries are no safer on the environment. 

My provincial government wanted residents to reduce the load on the electricity usage at peak times so they initiated off-peak rates. Evenings and weekends. It was SO successful that revenue dropped significantly, leading to rate increases to make up lost earnings.  Off-peak increased to the cost of the original peak rates. Another scam. 

I rarely see any reference to the huge increase in global population, thus, consuming more resources. And vacations/personal travel. 

Or globalization of foodstuffs. Sure, it’s nice to be able to buy mangoes in Canada but what is the carbon impact of shipping them? How far should we go with Climate Change initiatives? Everyone only consume what can be grown or manufactured in their local community? 

Cities keep expanding - pushing farm land further away - making transporting of produce a longer journey - requiring chemicals to serve as preservatives. Consumers are also visually fussy. So much produce gets wasted that doesn't look ""right"".

Textiles. People don’t make their own clothes and wear them every day until they are fully worn out. Landfills are not the place for clothing. But it's convenient. 

Everything about our lives is different to things a hundred years ago. It's not just straws or polystyrene/plastic or CFCs or cattle farts. 

Impactful climate change initiatives will mostly impact those who already have so little. Hence the lack of interest. 

I learned about the environment in elementary school. Reduce Reuse Recycle. Carried that mindset for forty years into adulthood. I now live in a country where recycling options are limited. Instead of curb-side pickup, it's on me to travel to a site to drop off everything, including garbage. The easiest options is to carry one garbage bag with everything, but i properly divide my waste as requested. 

But all my food waste now just goes in the garbage. There is no other option. 

I’ve traveled to very poor parts of Asia and Africa. They consume whatever they need to, to get by, and the last thing on their minds is saving the earth. So there is garbage strewn everywhere, which ends up in rivers and travels to oceans.  Billions of people have enough to do to survive that they aren't going to adopt Climate Change initiatives. We share one planet. 

I saw a report on the news that Canada’s recycling is shipped to Asia for sorting, and that it was just getting dumped there instead of being sorted. How about those carbon emissions for shipping?

Hierarchical Systems: Our solar system is a perfect example. The Sun is so dominant (99.86% of the mass) that, to a first approximation, every planet's orbit is a separate two-body problem with the Sun. The relative masses of the planets are only important when calculating their perturbations on each other's orbits. Jupiter's large relative mass makes it the dominant source of perturbations in the solar system.

Lagrange Points: The locations of the Lagrange points (L1, L2, etc.) are calculated based on the ratio of the two primary masses. For the Earth-Sun system, the L1 and L2 points are located at a specific fraction of the distance to the Sun, a fraction that depends only on the cube root of the Earth-Sun mass ratio.

Stability and Chaos: The long-term stability of an n-body system is highly sensitive to the relative masses.

A system with one massive star and several small planets can be stable for billions of years.

A system with three stars of comparable mass is almost certainly chaotic and unstable over long periods, with one body likely being ejected. Predicting this outcome is impossible without knowing the relative masses.",Infamous_Employer_85,1,1759084901,28-09-2025 18:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nog5cp/how_to_deal_with_a_parent_who_denies_climate/ngp18e0/

post,1nobx9c,,Researchers make stunning discovery after zapping rotting food with electricity: 'We are creating an industry',"""Lead author Saba Beenish said, ""We are creating an industry from another industry's waste.""

The discovery is as practical as it is cool since households are directly financially affected by food waste, and this can help put an end to the cycle. The Natural Resources Defense Council said in 2017 that the average U.S. family of four loses about $1,500 a year on food that goes uneaten.

Redirecting that waste into valuable chemicals instead of landfills could mean less pressure on food prices and grocery bills, while also reducing methane pollution that drives rising global temperatures and other changes in the climate. Reducing your own waste by meal planning or keeping food fresh for longer can also help.""",BillMortonChicago,231,1758616342,23-09-2025 08:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nobx9c/researchers_make_stunning_discovery_after_zapping/
comment,nfr9uk4,t3_1nobx9c,Researchers make stunning discovery after zapping rotting food with electricity: 'We are creating an industry',"In my opinion as an industry expert in the food waste space,  the issues around managing our food waste stems from our collection systems.  Most American cities laugh at the idea of a green bin collection program,  and similarly most restaurants in America just put it into one bin.  

Capturing emissions at the landfill is hopelessly inefficienct once the organics have been co-mingled with other contaminants,  not to mention sending all those nutrients to their grave and buying foreign fertilizer on the production side of the food economy 

I do biogas generation,  and it's an already efficient process.  I can produce a carbon *negative* gas and either offset NG or electricity from fossil fuels.  I'm also excited about emerging technology like this onein the article (look into microbial electrolysis cells too!). It doesn't solve the primary issues around food waste though:

a) nobody wants to separate it OR pay to separate it and;

Researchers make stunning discovery after zapping rotting food with electricity: 'We are creating an industry'

Food waste generates about 8-10% of global planet-warming gases and costs trillions each year, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. But a new study suggests electricity could help change that by turning rotting leftovers into useful industrial chemicals.

Scientists found that zapping food waste with a mild electrical current boosted the microbes that break it down, producing higher amounts of chemicals like acetone, ethanol, and butanol, as reported by Anthropocene. The approach could both reduce landfill waste and create valuable products from materials that are usually discarded.

Researchers at Ohio State University tested two species of Clostridium bacteria on sour cream and ice cream waste. In traditional high-heat fermentation tanks, the bacteria produced some useful chemicals. But in an electrofermentation system — where a conductor delivers electricity into a mix — the microbes made even more of those useful chemicals.

According to the study in the Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering, when the two bacteria were combined, they generated up to 12 times more butanol at a lower applied voltage compared to higher voltages, showing how tuning the electricity supply can change results.

Lead author Saba Beenish said, ""We are creating an industry from another industry's waste.""

The discovery is as practical as it is cool since households are directly financially affected by food waste, and this can help put an end to the cycle. The Natural Resources Defense Council said in 2017 that the average U.S. family of four loses about $1,500 a year on food that goes uneaten.

Redirecting that waste into valuable chemicals instead of landfills could mean less pressure on food prices and grocery bills, while also reducing methane pollution that drives rising global temperatures and other changes in the climate. Reducing your own waste by meal planning or keeping food fresh for longer can also help.

Turning food waste into chemicals also lessens reliance on oil and gas. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the ISCC, most ""platform chemicals"" have historically been derived from oil and gas, which then serve as the building blocks for thousands of environmentally harmful products, including plastics and other goods.

Replacing those with waste-based alternatives reduces both pollution and the need for drilling, resulting in cleaner air in communities where refineries and chemical plants are concentrated.

The team's findings show how electricity can unlock more value from food that would otherwise rot. If research like this scales, the leftover food scraps in your fridge could someday help power industries instead of filling landfills.",zaidazadkiel,1,1758740743,24-09-2025 19:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nobx9c/researchers_make_stunning_discovery_after_zapping/nfzxlt7/

We need big companies like Waste Management to roll out separate bins for food/organic waste. And incentivize people to sort properly by taking a few dollars off the total bill if you sign up. 


It's either that or someone heroic with the time and connections works with cities and farmers to to get them to pay for the city to collect food waste to use it for compost/fertilizer. You have to make it a profitable endeavor, no one will do it if they only see it as something that will cost money. ",AppropriateAd5225,5,1758645426,23-09-2025 16:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nobx9c/researchers_make_stunning_discovery_after_zapping/nfskx9k/

comment,nfrhjv4,t1_nfre3s0,Researchers make stunning discovery after zapping rotting food with electricity: 'We are creating an industry',"First step is to vote in politicians at the municipal level that aren't afraid to implement collections programs.  

I've seen a lot of waste programs,  and they all have downsides,  but the three bin system works reasonably well because it's constraint driven:

Each household gets three bins: black, blue and green.  

Black and blue get picked up on alternating weeks,  and the green gets picked up weekly.  So if you don't want to fill up your black and blue bin and have stinky bins sitting for two weeks,  you learn to separate out the organics.  

If your population can actually adhere to these separation rules,  it's actually pretty cheap and easy,  but given that in North America we're not especially... careful?... about adhering to rules that don't immediately benefit us,  we still need heavy downstream mechanical processing to further polish the separation.

comment,nfszky7,t1_nfs5jjj,Researchers make stunning discovery after zapping rotting food with electricity: 'We are creating an industry',"Absolutely:

Methane release is a byproduct of anaerobic (oxygen free) decomposition. Anywhere organics are decomposing, there will be some form of methane emissions. 

We know that methane is a significantly more impactful greenhouse gas than CO2 - This number keeps creeping **up**, when I started my career the number was 21 times the impact of CO2, but as we learn that the impacts are much more front loaded in terms of timing, that number has risen to more like 28-31x

https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-action/short-lived-climate-pollutants/national-black-carbon-methane-report.html

So if we grow food through photosynthesis, we're pulling CO2 from the air and using sunlight as energy to concentrate biomass in food. Eventually some gets wasted, and that portion then releases the methane. By facilitating this reaction under optimal conditions, we can instead capture this methane, release the energy contained within to offset fossil based energy and end up with CO2 and water, both significantly less impactful in terms of greenhouse impact as well as no **net gain** of carbon in the overall carbon cycle, versus pulling it out of the ground and adding to the system. 

You also end up with active biology fertilizer that replenishes the biology in the humus layer of the soil instead of just adding chemically derived fertilizer (N/P/K) compounds necessitating things like crop rotations so we don't deplete our soils organic fraction to the point where we get another dust bowl. 

Generally biogas from food waste is between 0 and -150 gCO2e/MJ when you account for the parasitic load of the facility, generally about 10% of the energy produced as an aggregate score for the facilities.",_echo_home_,3,1758649510,23-09-2025 17:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nobx9c/researchers_make_stunning_discovery_after_zapping/nfszky7/

Firm dates of implementation with enough runway that business can adapt and reroute those supply chains.

Easier is to implement an organics collection system, complete with RFPs that the commercial markets can build fleets off of. Beneficial use destinations will pop up as a result... I'll fill that gap if needed :P

At the policy level, we need to standardize carbon modelling - DEAR GOD DO WE NEED TO STANDARDIZE IT - and we need to assign benefit to the offset in chemically produced fertilizer. Currently most models don't account for this well, if at all (LOOKING AT YOU CFR)

At an individual level - most people are used to putting waste out by the curb and having it disappear. That's where it ends for them.

comment,nfuzjxq,t1_nfudcbf,Researchers make stunning discovery after zapping rotting food with electricity: 'We are creating an industry',"It's good tech, without a doubt, and the viability has definitely increased over the last two decades in terms of stability and ROI. Ultimately water and consistency are the challenges for pyrolysis:

 - Water requires huge amounts of energy to strip out of organics, and for many waste streams like grocery waste, the water content can be as high as 85% (we're mostly water remember). This can easily tip the EROI of the project into the negative, as drying the material for pyrolysis surpasses the energy outputs from the organics themselves via. Syngas

 - Consistency of material is important as control parameters need to be dialed in on high temp processes like this. Varying input materials can make these systems difficult to maintain consistency of outputs. 

 - One more minor challenge is finding a solution for the char or ash. Char is a hugely valuable material for soil remediation - it's porous and greatly increases the soil's ability to retain water. This is unfortunately undervalued in modern agriculture as it's not as easy to quantify directly do to the numerous other variables that go into crop yields. Regardless, char from biomass is stable carbon sequestration, albeit relatively short term.

comment,nfts2q4,t1_nfr48f7,can other countries ramp up lowering their carbon output to negate what america is currently doing?,"Well, if we just look at emissions, the US' back-pedalling may well be worse than Russia or Israel's war-related emissions. I'm not saying it is necessarily, but if it is, you've got the answer to your question: Less than it was under Biden.

I suspect that the US emissions will continue to fall as they have since 2007 ([link](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-emissions-per-country?country=CAN~USA~GBR~FRA~DEU~ITA~JPN)). Renewables just make more and more sense. But US emissions' decline from 2025 to 2030 will almost certainly be less dramatic than it was through the end of 2024. It will take a while to sort out how much of that reduced decline will be due to Trump, as the rise of AI is a major factor. In a few years, we'll know.

comment,nfrln38,t1_nfpqw8a,S&P Global predicts a 50% chance of exceeding +2.3°C by 2040,">The first evidence of C4-dominated grasslands is from Kenya and Uganda in eastern Africa, at about **21 to 16 million years ago**. The inference that C4 grasses were present comes from phytoliths, stable carbon isotope analyses, and other types of data. Most global evidence for widespread dominance of C4 grasslands is less than 10 million years old. 

>There are various hypotheses explaining the shift from the predominance of C3 to C4 grasses in the Neogene. One hypothesis is that the relatively frequent fires associated with grasses (and, specifically, C4 grasses) acted as a positive feedback mechanism, thereby further increasing C4 grass abundance. Grassland-fire feedbacks are generally seen as a major stimulator of C4 grass-dominated ecosystems and function to maintain and even spread grasslands today.

>**A decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) occurred around the same time as this vegetation shift**. While scientists previously believed that this decline was caused by an increase in C4 photosynthesis that drew down the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere, **they now more commonly think that the drop in atmospheric carbon dioxide caused a shift to more C4 photosynthesis. C4 photosynthesis shuttles carbon dioxide into specialized bundle sheath cells in the leaf, which reduces photorespiration, the wasteful use of an oxygen molecule rather than a carbon dioxide molecule during the photosynthetic process.** C4 plants are therefore more efficient at using of carbon dioxide during photosynthesis than C3 plants, and lower concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide may have favored plants with C4 photosynthesis.

During the Pliocene (5.3 to 2.6 million years ago), the climate became increasingly cold and arid, **facilitating the expansion of grasslands in low-latitude areas**. The Pliocene saw further increases in the expansion of C4-dominated vegetation on almost all continents.

Nuclear reactors could also be produced more quickly and cheaply than is done today.

I agree rich countries will be able to adapt much better than poorer ones.

Unfortunately most of the global population falls into the ‘poor’ category. This is a problem. 

I also agree that clean energy is growing hugely. 7% solar and the biggest mover. China is being big here. The US not so much but money pushes stronger than politics

I agree 100% we have now drought of energy- if used correctly (and hydrocarbons isn’t it). 

We do, apparently, have something of a worry. The energy imbalance from what comes in and goes out. This affects simple and complex systems. 

I believe it to be quite simple but where the outputs are very complex.

Some few individuals are, and those few don't want to spend their wealth combatting the problems they've created. They also don't want to spend our *shared* wealth on it either, so they block legislation that would address it in favor of tax cuts for themselves.

Energy superabundance doesn't help or matter if most of that energy is being sucked up by non-productive crypto miners and AI developers. Remember, for capitalism to work, it relies on value derived from scarcity, which is why farmers dump milk into gutters when prices are too low, and why luxury brands burn their excess inventory rather than donate it. Energy prices will remain high due to structured scarcity. It doesn't take much: closing a refinery for ""routine maintenance"" just before peak driving season is an example.

## Key Context
These analogs show that **+7 °C global warming** is not unprecedented in Earth’s history, but past episodes were associated with:  
- Ice-free poles and very high sea levels  
- Collapsed ecosystems and mass extinctions (in the Permian and PETM)  
- Radically different distributions of life on land and in the oceans  

Unlike the past, today’s warming is occurring **10–100 times faster**, giving ecosystems and societies far less time to adapt.

Correct, it does not.  But we know how to make glacials more similar to today's climate (by adding GHGs to the atmosphere).

At its simplest, Earth’s energy balance can be written as:

(1 - \alpha)\, S \, \frac{\pi R^2}{4 \pi R^2} \;=\; \sigma T^4

Where:
	•	S = solar constant (≈ 1361 W m^{-2})
	•	\alpha = planetary albedo (fraction of sunlight reflected, ≈ 0.3)
	•	R = Earth’s radius
	•	\sigma = Stefan–Boltzmann constant (5.67 \times 10^{-8}\, \text{W m}^{-2}\text{K}^{-4})
	•	T = effective radiating temperature of Earth

⸻

Simplified form (energy flux per unit area):

(1 - \alpha)\, \frac{S}{4} \;=\; \sigma T^4

Left-hand side = average incoming solar energy absorbed.
Right-hand side = outgoing thermal radiation.

We can tell that the extra CO2 is from us, not natural, because the ratio of radioactive carbon in the atmosphere's CO2 is decreasing. Fossil fuel carbon is non-radioactive because it's been isolated underground for millions of years.

comment,nfubn68,t1_nfmvtgx,Natural changes vs Man-made,"Ok, so you seem to think all climate change is humanity. An example of natural climate change is like, instead of mountaintop removal, a volcano erupts. The clouds block the sun, the magma rains down, killing people and wildlife in a similar fashion to the floods. Pompeii is straight fucked, you can see it from Europe and Asia.


Awful, awful thing to happen. But it was going to happen. Nobody caused it to happen, that's just what happens when you build on a fault line, that's just how the planet works.


This is different from deliberately blowing up a mountain range with explosives. 


Edit: Things do tend to recover from natural climate change, as well.  The carbon released from the volcano is going to be around for a few years, and will fuck up the weather. But the volcanic ash is fertile. Plants will grow and start sucking up that carbon, and in a few hundred years, humans will go back to Pompeii and take tours and photographs and marvel at the destructive power of nature and how bad it can fuck you up. 


The earth is also on a cycle where the climate changes naturally every few hundred thousand years as we get closer and farther away from the sun.  Humans are fucking up the atmosphere and therefore fucking that up in a way we shouldn't, because it makes it more hostile for humans. We really should be fucking it up in the other direction to the point that when I was a kid there were real scientists proposing nuclear winter as an actual way to combat climate change. Humans can only survive in an ice age, because we need predictable seasons. We should have at least another 500,000 years to figure this out, but folks don't know how to act.  The 6th KT event was always coming, but we should have had time to get our shit together. 


And we still could. We still have time but we need to pull our head out of our ass as quickly as possible. 


And, btw, even when that happened naturally, we would still have been fucked if we didn't do something.

I'd have to have more information to answer this, it largely depends on whether the species is invasive to the area to classify it for our purposes, because this person is specifically asking about the difference between something being natural vs created by humans. 


Trying to pretend something existing in nature is the same as something being naturally occurring is not going to fly to a Kentuckian looking at a wall of kudzo.

Null hypothesis are for individual scientific studies. They have literally nothing to do with this broad statement, even a little but.  Like not only are they not in the same ballpark, they're not in the same state. 


Like you're not right but you're not even wrong, it seems like you're just saying random words in random orders so you're going to have to help me make the connection. 


The null hypothesis is always, ""nothing, "".  That's why it's called a null hypothesis. That cannot apply to broad statements. 


Like, ""mountaintop removal will cause vast deforestation, "" is a hypothesis. ""Mountaintop removal will cause no change in the environment, "" is the null hypothesis in that study. 


A null hypothesis cannot, by definition, be something, it has to be nothing. It only exists to contrast the something in case nothing happens. It's not any kind of standard, it exists solely in case nothing happens. It's just the opposite of the hypothesis. So I have no idea what you're trying to say. 


Edit : Essentially I need to know how you're connecting the concept of a standard to the concept of a null hypothesis because in reality these are completely unrelated things. The null hypothesis literally only exists because of like, formatting, like for clarification in how we write study results. It's not connected to any kind of standard so I don't know what you're trying to say. ",Acceptable-Remove792,2,1758717106,24-09-2025 12:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nns9aw/natural_changes_vs_manmade/nfxqkdk/

Seasonal hurricane forecasts don't really have anything to do with climate change.

>The **proportion** of intense TCs (tropical cyclones/tropical storms), average peak TC wind speeds, and peak wind speeds of the most intense TCs will increase on the global scale with increasing global warming (high confidence)

>The total global frequency of TC formation will decrease or remain unchanged with increasing global warming (medium confidence).

What this is saying is that the expectation (albeit not with the highest confidence) is for the total number of tropical cyclones formed to reduce but, of those which do form and sustain to something like hurricane size, an increased proportion will then intensify further to the highest categories. I.e. if something develops to Cat1 it will become increasingly likely that it will further develop to Cat5.

This does not necessarily mean an increased total number of Cat5 hurricanes - there's currently no clear consensus on how those competing factors will shake out into absolute numbers. It's that proportionally we expect the trend of Cat5 count/Cat1 count to increase over time",skeeezoid,4,1758559865,22-09-2025 16:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nnlozb/rationally_discuss_this_where_are_all_the_cat5/nfmll3k/

Yes.  And just because there's what *feels like* a lull doesn't disprove that.  We've had hurricanes so far this year, even a REALLY big one, it's just that it went out to sea and no one really noticed.  There's one out there now that's going to hit cat 4 in a few days, that again is going to stay out to sea.

You're just misintrepreting the information.  No scientist has ever said ""we KNOW that EVERY year, a LOT of big storms will make US landfall.""  You're pretending they are saying that, and they never have.

They have said ""the *chances* of hurricanes is going up"" and ""the chances of more severe storms goes up.""  That isn't disproven by your observations.   They don't make annual guarantees, and they say *nothing at all* about landfall. If someone said a coin flip is a 50/50 chance, and you got three tails in a row, would you say that proved the statistics wrong?

comment,nfg3kz2,t3_1nmx4ti,Zeke Hausfather | A Responsible Way to Cool the Planet (Gift Article),"## Article Summary: ""A Responsible Way to Cool the Planet""


# Main Arguments

**The Problem:**

- Reduced sulfur pollution from cleaner air regulations has inadvertently accelerated climate change
- Sulfur particles previously reflected sunlight, providing about one-third protection against CO2 warming
- Global sulfur emissions have dropped 40% since 2006, with China reducing theirs by 70%
- This ""unmasking"" of greenhouse gas warming contributed to extreme heat events in 2024

**The Proposed Solution:**

- Deploy high-altitude aircraft to inject sulfuric acid droplets into the upper atmosphere
- This would mimic natural volcanic cooling (like Mount Pinatubo in 1991)
- Much more efficient than ground-level sulfur - requires far less material for same cooling effect
- Would cause 100 times fewer health impacts than fossil fuel sulfur emissions

**Key Limitations and Risks:**

- **Not a cure:** Only treats symptoms, not the underlying CO2 problem
- **Temporary:** Warming returns immediately if stopped; CO2 warming persists for millennia
- **Side effects:** Ozone depletion, potential rainfall pattern changes
- **Moral hazard:** Risk of reducing urgency for emissions cuts and carbon removal

### Recommended Approach

The authors advocate for a **bounded, temporary program** with strict constraints:

- Only compensate for lost sulfur cooling, not provide additional cooling
- Start small with imperceptible increments
- Include regular monitoring for side effects
- Clear exit strategy tied to achieving net-zero emissions
- Never exceed current natural sulfur cooling levels

### Authors' Qualifications

- Climate research lead at Stripe
- Research scientist with Berkeley Earth

**David Keith:**

- Professor of geophysical sciences at University of Chicago
- Founding director of the Climate Systems Engineering Initiative

comment,nfh3okq,t1_nfgziny,Zeke Hausfather | A Responsible Way to Cool the Planet (Gift Article),"The Mount Pinatubo eruption cited in the article created a concentrated aerosol layer that absorbed both incoming solar radiation and outgoing longwave (terrestrial) radiation from Earth's surface. This absorption caused a significant, short-term warming effect in the stratosphere. In the months following the eruption, the tropical lower stratosphere experienced a temperature increase of up to 3.5°. This can be contrasted with the reflection of solar radiation by the aerosol cloud prevented sunlight from reaching the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) and Earth's surface, which resulted in a temporary global cooling effect of about 0.5°C over the following two years.

The question remains whether large stratospheric aerosol injections similar to this are actually an effective method of Solar Radiation Management. The blog post does not go into the many, many deleterious effects of such injections, which are the sort of thing I would personally like to see explored in the form of a peer reviewed scientific paper on this topic, and especially one that leverages GCMs to make its argument.

No! Hence the need for studying the problem inside of a computer first and coming up with a model where we've demonstrated it actually improves over the status quo before we attempt any sort of field deployment. Sulfate aerosols are widely recognized as a PM2.5 pollutant which contributes to adverse health effects such as reduced lung function and increased risk of cardiovascular problems. Sulfates contribute to acid rain and damage to ecosystems.

> It speaks of damage to the ozone layer and health effects.

Yes, but that's just one example.

Stratospheric warming events, such as a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW), can cause the stratospheric polar vortex to weaken, shift, or even split. The atmospheric disturbance can propagate downward to the troposphere, where the jet stream is located. This can cause the jet stream to become more wavy and less stable. Jetstream instabilities caused by global warming are already causing numerous problems.

This can lead to extreme cold air outbreaks, where a highly disrupted jet stream can allow frigid arctic air to spill out of the polar regions and move south into mid-latitude regions like the U.S., Europe, and Asia.

The altered jet stream can also lead to more persistent weather patterns, such as prolonged cold snaps or persistent blocking high-pressure systems that cause heat waves.

Fundamentally, SRM via stratospheric sulfate aerosol injections doesn't actually solve any problem, it just moves the problem around, and in the process creates new problems. Whether these new problems are better or worse than the old problems is a complex question, and one which can't be adequately explained in a non-peer-reviewed blog post.",bascule,2,1758483948,21-09-2025 19:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nmx4ti/zeke_hausfather_a_responsible_way_to_cool_the/nfh5ql8/

Not among the GHGs, it is 14% of the GHG gases

>I didn’t mention it before, but since you did, 95% of greenhouse gas is water vapor,

Water vapor is at 0.3%, and is responsible for 70% of warming. The amount of water vapor it the atmosphere, the amount of water in the atmosphere is governed by the  Clausius-Clapeyron relation, and increases as GMST increases, this increase has been observed.

>So in fact man doesn’t produce 5% of green house gasses, 

Your 5% is incorrect, and your previous assertion was that natural sources are 95% of CO2 emissions, human sources are 100 times greater than volcanic sources.  

Look at the carbon cycle image if you are still confused.

>no proof CO2 is even a green house gas

There is, it strongly absorbs IR at 15 microns, which is near the peak of the spectrum emitted by the surface of the earth.

CO2 has increased from 285 ppm to 428 ppm in the last 150 years.  We know the increase is from ancient carbon sources by looking at the isotope ratios of carbon in the atmospheric CO2.

>Temperature rises first, then CO2 levels follow

Old argument, CO2 causes temperature to increase too.

In the past, Milankovitch cycles started with a temperature rise, which caused CO2 to be released, which amplified the warming. CO2 acts feedback, making the warming stronger

And the CO2 in the atmosphere currently has isotopic ratios that shows that the CO2 is from ancient carbon sources.  We burn 9 trillion kg of ancient carbon per year, adding 38 trillion kg of CO2 to the atmosphere every year.

If somebody does a tiny action and sees results, that tiny action can have untold benefits later on. People aren't born an activist or a scientist, they work bit by bit to increase their understanding and ideally become passionate.

Energy grids are results of many individual choices. If a person chooses to consume energy willy-nilly that's produced by coal/gas/etc., it is a type of endorsement of that energy generation. If they continue to elect politicians whom allow subsidies for fossil fuel energy, add unfair barriers for renewable energy, and do not penalize fossil fuel energy for wrecking the planet, it's another type of endorsement. Markets respond to demand, if people restricted their use depending on choices of utilities then utilities would respond. Solar and wind power have been among the cheapest for utilities (along with hydro that cannot be expanded much more) for many years now. People on average consume a tremendous amount of energy unnecessarily: heating homes to summer temps in winter and making homes chilly in summer, able-bodied people driving to a grocery store in their own neighborhoods rather than walking/biking/etc., and so on. Humans can survive without incessant use of individual motor vehicles. During the COVID shutdowns, fossil fuel use declined so much that many fossil fuel companies went out of business and some were selling petroleum at negative prices (paying to have supply taken off their hands because storing it cost them money). Air quality around the world improved dramatically, when people were driving a lot less. Many types of jobs adapted, so that people worked at home and so forth. Yes I know many restaurants and other types of businesses depending on in-person customer visits went out of business, but commerce doesn't require people to drive cars every time they travel a short distance.

comment,nfob4te,t1_nfl5anh,"For the climate, little things don't add up","You didn't make any kind of fact-based argument for this. Quotes from the ridiculous article:

>That’s why I’ve started pausing my microwave one second early. That might not save much energy, but if everyone in the world did it, it would save way more energy than I’ll use in my whole life!

Clearly this is ridiculing the idea of individual changes collectively making a difference. That was followed up with:

>Something seems wrong here.

Then they engaged in a mathematical exercise, based on this silly idea of a tiny change, rather than use an example such as people choosing to not drive cars for short trips that could be walked/biked/etc.

>But I worry that this basic intuition is lost on a lot of people when they say things like “tiny things add up.” Tiny things add up absolutely, but they don’t add up relatively.

Then they brought it around to their obsession with supporting the LLM chatbots industry.

Then after dismissing changes to individual behaviors which empower the fossil fuels industry, they suggest ineffective options such as donating to climate charities (they're powerless mostly if people do not change their habits) and voting (when any candidate likely to win is roughly similar in supporting what their financial donors want).

Then another mathematical exercise, not based on real-world data.

Then they did make some suggestions for individual action, but three of the four involve buying stuff. The other is ""Skipping a flight if there’s another way of traveling."" Why not just ""Refrain from airplane travel""? Flying across the country causes a lot of pollution, so does driving. Maybe just don't go across the country if not necessary?

comment,nfbkdsc,t1_nfbjpci,"For the climate, little things don't add up","It's not correct at all to say that energy grids are just the result of individual choices. If the power I draw is from a nearby coal plant, making coffee is going to be much worse for the climate than if I made the same lifestyle choice but relied on 100% solar. In both cases, my individual choice is the same (making coffee), but the emissions of the grid are drastically different. The negative climate effects of people's lifestyle choices are mostly due to the sources of energy the local grid draws from, and individual people aren't directly choosing which source to use when they make their lifestyle choices.

Changes to the grid are fundamentally different than individual lifestyle changes, because someone could keep their lifestyle the same while the grid changes a lot.

No. The article is very clearly saying that you should do things that have the biggest net impact for climate, and make it clear to others that they should be doing that too. Personal lifestyle changes are not going to have nearly as much impact as changing the makeup of the energy grid.

>The intention of the math exercises is obviously to push your claim that collective action about small things also results in small change. But the entire article overlooks that people can make many small changes and some larger changes, and collectively those could have massive impacts.

The point of the article is that collective action around tiny things is a bad waste of time, collective action around big things is a necessary move to fix the climate.

>All pollution is due to individual action. If nobody bought new cell phones, there would be no pollution from manufacturing cell phones. Etc. for any other type of pollution.

Yes, and cell phones are a tiny tiny tiny slice of the carbon pie. If everyone who cared about climate didn't buy a cell phone, this seems much more likely to cause the climate movement to lose social influence compared to how much it actually helps. That's a ridiculous recommendation when we have such massive other problems and so few people are actually willing to take action on them.

I didn't recommend that people stop using cell phones. I gave an example to illustrate that ALL EMISSIONS ARE EMISSIONS OF INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS. People need not upgrade their phones every two years, and most could choose to get used phones considering the number of phones in existence that are not in use. The collective impact of cell phone manufacturing globally is actually quite large. Every phone represents impacts from mining, refining, construction of factories, energy use, toxic waste, intercontinental transportation, etc.

Second TW 3 years.
Third TW just over 2 years. 

On top of which it wastes far less than fossil fuels by design. So it's not a one for one transition. Assuming good storage like batteries. You should need about 50% less production according to the experts.

This is why while it only produces 7% of total electricity the amount of end is power is closer to 20% because it is not wasted in heat, transmission and production at the wrong times. Just listen to a good article on this. 

Also if we just added batteries to existing power and collected excess power at night and weekends we could make the grid a lot more efficient and use less power. Same principle as a water tower.

A couple quick things.  (1) In the US, I know of only one example of carbon capture and storage at the stack.  This was at the Petra Nova coal fired, power plant in Houston.  

The captured co2 was intended for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), but even with that economic benefit, the amine capture system was only used from 2017/2020, being deemed uneconomical after that and disconnected.  

Very little money is going into carbon capture at the stack.  This is actually bad, because the flue gas of a coal plant is 1/7th to 1/10th co2.  It is VERY concentrated.  As opposed to the delusions of Direct Air Capture (DAC), where the concentration is 1/2500th.  

The big money is going into DAC, where the effective cost is over $1,000/ton.  Not the base cost.  The base cost is around $500/ton.  But it takes so much energy to extract the CO2 from thin air, that about 0.6 tons of co2 are emitted for every one ton captured.  And that is why the true cost, is over $1,000/net ton removed.  

Even if we could fill the safe storage formations in the Earth with CO2 from DAC, the current cost would be over One Trillion Dollars per Gigaton.  Roughly 1.5 QUADRILLION dollars to fill the whole enchilada.  If you could get everyone on board to redirect 10% of our Global GDP, or Gross World Product to this endeavor, it would cost 11 Trillion/year - for 140 years.

DAC is a planet sized cigarette filter.  Sounds good in theory.  Totally worthless in practice.",mem2100,4,1758331281,20-09-2025 01:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nliwrs/how_the_role_of_carbon_storage_has_been_hugely/nf69afn/

That is far higher than most estimates

We would need to remove about 5 billion tons per year once we get emissions below 5 Gt per year, at $500 per ton that is $600 billion, at $1000 that is $4 trillion.  Natural systems currently sequester about 18 Gt per year

>Petra Nova coal fired, power plant in Houston.

Estimates put that capture at under $100 per ton

>Very little money is going into carbon capture at the stack

Because coal use is starting to decline, replacing coal plants with solar and wind is less expensive, those have emissions of under 10 grams per kWh.  A coal plant with carbon capture of 90% has emissions of 70 grams per kWh, and the carbon capture increases cost of electricity from those plants even more.

>it takes so much energy to extract the CO2 from thin air, that about 0.6 tons of co2 are emitted for every one ton captured.

Not when using solar, wind, or geothermal sources.  For example Climeworks uses geothermal and is under 0.1 tons (0.05–0.1 tons)",Infamous_Employer_85,1,1758568975,22-09-2025 19:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nliwrs/how_the_role_of_carbon_storage_has_been_hugely/nfnghsm/

comment,nf5atay,t3_1nlgfox,"EU to announce emissions cut of between 66.25% and 72.5% by 2035, compared to 1990 levels for COP 30","#EU to announce emissions cut of between 66.25% and 72.5% by 2035, compared to 1990 levels for COP 30

At this week's UN General Assembly, the EU will present a target range of 66.25% to 72.5% emissions reduction by 2035 compared to 1990 levels, rather than a specific number. This cautious approach comes as member states remain divided on ambition levels, with the bloc still working toward a binding 2040 target of 90% reduction that remains under negotiation.

EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra defended the range approach, suggesting it gives flexibility while maintaining momentum toward the COP30 climate summit in Brazil later this year. Critics, however, see it as ""Olympic-level diplomatic gymnastics"" designed to avoid arriving at international climate talks empty-handed.

The EU has a historic setting targets that initially seem ambitious, then dramatically exceeding them as technology and policy accelerate beyond expectations.

The EU's 2020 climate package, adopted in 2008, aimed for modest ""20-20-20"" targets: 20% emissions reduction, 20% renewable energy, and 20% energy efficiency improvements compared to 1990 levels. The EU achieved a 31% emissions reduction—exceeding its target by 11 percentage points. Renewable energy reached 22.1%, comfortably surpassing the 20% goal.

Emboldened by this success, the EU dramatically raised its ambitions in 2021. The European Climate Law increased the 2030 target from 40% to ""at least 55%"" emissions reduction, accompanied by the ""Fit for 55"" legislative package. At the time, many questioned whether such a leap was feasible.

Recent data suggests the EU's conservative approach to target-setting may once again prove unnecessarily cautious. Renewable energy deployment has accelerated far beyond expectations:

- Renewables jumped from 34% of electricity generation in 2019 to 47% in 2024
- Solar power rose above coal for the first time in 2024
- Fossil fuels now represent a historic low of just 29% of EU electricity generation

Most tellingly, analysis shows EU member states now target 66% renewable electricity by 2030—just shy of the ambitious 69% REPowerEU goal set during the energy crisis. This represents a dramatic shift from earlier projections that suggested the EU would struggle to reach even 39% renewables by 2030.

With renewables deployment accelerating and fossil fuel use in structural decline, the bloc appears increasingly likely to exceed its 2030 targets.'",Economy-Fee5830,1,1758318972,19-09-2025 21:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nlgfox/eu_to_announce_emissions_cut_of_between_6625_and/nf5atay/

For now, yes, but the car makers are lobbying very hard for PHEV exception, but real world data shows PHEVs emit 5x more than in the ideal case, so they are having an uphill battle.

The EU's rule on power sector CO2 emissions have been extremely effective.

EU appliance efficiency rules have also been very impactful.

The EU's carbon trading scheme has helped push EVs by fining companies which sell more polluting cars and also kept giant SUVs off our roads.

comment,nf42mum,t3_1nlag9o,Are climate change corrections adding to climate change?,"Let me start off by stating the law of conservation of energy “no energy is created nor destroyed rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another”

First off let start with solar farm. 

Dark solar panels absorb a large portion of sunlight, lowering terrestrial albedo at solar farm sites (👎), solar farms are also known to increase precipitation when built in deserts (👍)

Floating solar panels on water create a reflective surface that partially blocks sunlight from reaching the water and reducing water evaporation

So the overall effect of solar farms depends on weather the amount of energy absorbed by the panels is greater than equal to or less than the decrease in albedo effect from placing the panels there rather than let the land/water absorb/reflect the sun energy back to to space through the atmosphere

Next is wind farms

They extract kinetic energy from the atmosphere, slowing winds and slightly altering mixing in the boundary layer.

This can shift local temperature and humidity patterns, especially at night, but studies show the global impact is negligible compared to fossil fuel warming.",xiangkunwan,5,1758305511,19-09-2025 18:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nlag9o/are_climate_change_corrections_adding_to_climate/nf42mum/

They claim they are unbiased because they are using science as the basis of their accusations. Regardless of whether or not they are being truthful is a different matter. They may be humans with bias, but they are being unbiased in the framework they have provided. Their claims are valid and so are yours, but from my perspective they aren't because of the method in which they are attempting to provide information, from the standpoint of science. I'm not arguing for the sake of arguing, but I believe calling everyone biased is an oversimplification of the human experience when that same bias is applied to one of the greatest tools we have: Science. It's like trying to say all eggs contain yolk when you haven't even cracked them. Yes, humans have biases, but they aren't incapable of removing them. When you claim that you're setting up the expectation of inability to move past harmful interpretations in claiming that they all always have bias.

I must have communicated badly, because I agree with you! 

In fact, my point was that the basic research, which is fundamental to all scientific study, has so little funding that any nefarious motivation must be almost completely absent.

July 2025 - Dr. Andreas Gorbach, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler Truck AG, responsible for Truck Technology:

“Those who want to lead the transport of the future will not rely on either-or, but on both battery AND hydrogen. By combining both technologies, and thus also building charging and refueling infrastructure in parallel, the decarbonization of transport can take place at higher speed and lower cost. Europe still has the historic opportunity to remain a technology leader in hydrogen and fuel cells and thereby massively strengthen the competitiveness of its industrial base. Whether this happens is also a question of political will to act.”",CptnMillerArmy,1,1758277262,19-09-2025 10:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1nka1do/why_billionaire_wendy_schmidt_is_doubling_down_on/nf1o4zm/

It is not impossible at all.  China is already in process of deploying 15,000 1 MW chargers, 1.5MW would be the next step.  They are already making passenger EVs that charge at 500 kW.

There’s no sense in cutting funding from emissions reductions because frankly there’s not loads of money going into it in the first place. At best it’s like 1% of the cost of infrastructure projects. Spend another 1% on mitigation and you’re golden.

The argument that “other countries emit more so what’s the point” is silly for a few reasons:

1) the UK is a wealthy country with enormous historical emissions and is the 6th biggest economy in the world. If we can’t lead the charge to reduce, who can?

2) The money spent is not wasted - it goes into innovation, nature restoration, and important infrastructure projects. This means jobs and ecological services that we need to survive.

3) China is investing billions into renewables and other green investments and their emissions have turned the corner this year. So other countries *are* doing their bit.

comment,netprdl,t3_1njuwsq,Coal and Oil Temperature Increase,"To get burn all that by the end of the century - you'd need to increase coal burn rates by just over 50%.  At this moment, we have about 50 years of oil reserves at current consumption rates, however we generally find a little more oil each year than we consume.  Note:  Back in 2000, 25 years ago, we had about 50 years of oil reserves, but our annual consumption was lower.  In raw terms, we had prove reserves of 1.3 Trillion barrels in 2000, today we have 1.75 Trillion in proven reserves.  In 2000, daily oil consumption was just under 80 million barrels, last year it was just over 100 million barrels a day.  We had 1.3 Trillion in reserve in 2000.  Since then, we have consumed roughly 800 BILLION barrels.  Without any new finds we would be down to a reserve of 500 billion, instead we found so much oil (1.25 trillion new barrels), that we have 1.75 Trillion in reserve.  

Let's just do this.  Assume oil stays where it is in consumption rates and coal increases by 50% for the next 75 years.  Ballpark we add 2.5 PPM/year CO2.  This would jack that up to more than 3.5 PPM - assuming our carbon sinks keep on, keepin on.  That's key, because at present, those sinks absorb half of all the CO2 we emit.  Ballpark - that would take us from 430 PPM to 700 PPM.  If however - our sinks weakened and some turned to sources, as would almost certainly happen under this scenario, we would likely be increasing levels by 5-7 PPM/year - putting us between 800 PPM and 950 PPM.  

Having answered your question, I will ask you one in turn.  At current course and speed, what specific environmental pressure do you think is going to cause the most destruction between now and 2050?

1. Raw increase in temps

2. Forest fires

3. Storms (hurricanes and tornados)

4. Drought

5. Floods

6. Rising sea levels

7. Loss of cryosphere (polar sea ice, glaciers)

8. Other (I'm sure I left out a few)",mem2100,6,1758165369,18-09-2025 03:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1njuwsq/coal_and_oil_temperature_increase/netprdl/

Turns out that, well, it is VERY UNLIKELY that we can force a full runaway greenhouse -- so you're right -- BUT the POSSIBILITY cannot be ruled out with present knowledge. 

Of course this is all just an abstract exercise, what really matters is that on the present actual trajectory the IPCC finds something like a 5% chance that we'll exceed 4.5C in the lifetime of today's kids.

It's based upon the dates when we started adding a significant amount of CO2 the the atmosphere.  

https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-co-emissions

Emissions in 1900 were about 0.6Gt per year, emissions today are over 60 times greater.

Which caused a large increase atmospheric CO2.

The industrial revolution marks the beginning of a strong increase in the use of **fossil fuels**, initially coal, and hence emission of **carbon dioxide (CO2)**.

>The furnaces of the world are now burning about 2,000,000,000 tons of coal a year. When this is burned, uniting with oxygen, it adds about 7,000,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere yearly. This tends to make the air a more effective blanket for the earth and to raise its temperature. The effect may be considerable in a few centuries.

Agreed, taking the average between 1850 to 1900 is likely not a good baseline.

post,1njg6pt,,Scientists warn of abrupt shifts across Antarctica’s fragile climate - The Brighter Side of News,"""Research published by a team from the Australian National University and the University of New South Wales highlights the growing risks.

Working with scientists from Australia’s main Antarctic research centers, the group found that the systems of ice, ocean, and ecosystems in the region are becoming increasingly unstable.

Their conclusion is blunt: without swift action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Antarctica could pass irreversible thresholds that would reshape the planet.

An interconnected crisis

The study emphasizes that no single system in Antarctica changes in isolation.

The loss of sea ice, warming oceans, and collapsing ice shelves are intertwined.

One shift can spark another, creating feedback loops that accelerate damage.

The result is a cascade of abrupt events that could unfold faster than predicted, making adaptation harder.""",BillMortonChicago,69,1758122713,17-09-2025 15:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1njg6pt/scientists_warn_of_abrupt_shifts_across/
